Overview
========

Scrapy is a BSD-licensed fast high-level web crawling and web scraping framework, used to
crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages. It can be used for
a wide range of purposes, from data mining to monitoring and automated testing.

Welcome to Scrapy, A web crawler or spider are synonymous terms for a utility written 
in a programming language that indexes content from all over the Internet. The goal
of such a web crawler is to learn what the page is about and then retrieve what is
actually needed. Scrapy is simply an instance of this application. They are called
such as they automatically go around websites looking at metadata and obtaining
the data via a software program usually written in this case Python. 

A web crawler is similar to going to a library of unorganized books and putting
together a card catalog quickly so information can be found easily.  In order
to do the task, the web crawler will look at the topics, title, and summary to
figure out what goes where. This is similar to how this will function on the
internet. You can use Scrapy in a multitude of ways. One example would be 
extracting headlines from a news source and creating your own headline
aggregating platform for things that you are interested in. The sky is
the limit with Scrapy. Please see our technical documentation to get started.
