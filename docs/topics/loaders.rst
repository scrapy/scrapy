Item Loaders
============

.. module:: scrapy.loader
   :synopsis: Item Loader class

Item Loaders provide a convenient mechanism for populating scraped :ref:`Items
<topics-items>`. Even though Items can be populated using their own
dictionary-like API, Item Loaders provide a much more convenient API for
populating them from a scraping process, by automating some common tasks like
parsing the raw extracted data before assigning it.

In other words, :ref:`Items <topics-items>` provide the *container* of
scraped data, while Item Loaders provide the mechanism for *populating* that
container.

Item Loaders are designed to provide a flexible, efficient and easy mechanism
for extending and overriding different field parsing rules, either by spider,
or by source format (HTML, XML, etc) without becoming a nightmare to maintain.

Using Item Loaders to populate items
====================================

To use an Item Loader, you must first instantiate it. You can either
instantiate it with a dict-like object (e.g. Item or dict) or without one, in
which case an Item is automatically instantiated in the Item Loader ``__init__`` method
using the Item class specified in the :attr:`ItemLoader.default_item_class`
attribute.

Then, you start collecting values into the Item Loader, typically using
:ref:`Selectors <topics-selectors>`. You can add more than one value to
the same item field; the Item Loader will know how to "join" those values later
using a proper processing function.

.. note:: Collected data is internally stored as lists,
   allowing to add several values to the same field.
   If an ``item`` argument is passed when creating a loader,
   each of the item's values will be stored as-is if it's already
   an iterable, or wrapped with a list if it's a single value.

Here is a typical Item Loader usage in a :ref:`Spider <topics-spiders>`, using
the :ref:`Product item <topics-items-declaring>` declared in the :ref:`Items
chapter <topics-items>`::

    from scrapy.loader import ItemLoader
    from myproject.items import Product

    def parse(self, response):
        l = ItemLoader(item=Product(), response=response)
        l.add_xpath('name', '//div[@class="product_name"]')
        l.add_xpath('name', '//div[@class="product_title"]')
        l.add_xpath('price', '//p[@id="price"]')
        l.add_css('stock', 'p#stock]')
        l.add_value('last_updated', 'today') # you can also use literal values
        return l.load_item()

By quickly looking at that code, we can see the ``name`` field is being
extracted from two different XPath locations in the page:

1. ``//div[@class="product_name"]``
2. ``//div[@class="product_title"]``

In other words, data is being collected by extracting it from two XPath
locations, using the :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_xpath` method. This is the
data that will be assigned to the ``name`` field later.

Afterwards, similar calls are used for ``price`` and ``stock`` fields
(the latter using a CSS selector with the :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_css` method),
and finally the ``last_update`` field is populated directly with a literal value
(``today``) using a different method: :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_value`.

Finally, when all data is collected, the :meth:`ItemLoader.load_item` method is
called which actually returns the item populated with the data
previously extracted and collected with the :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_xpath`,
:meth:`~ItemLoader.add_css`, and :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_value` calls.

.. _topics-loaders-processors:

Input and Output processors
===========================

An Item Loader contains one input processor and one output processor for each
(item) field. The input processor processes the extracted data as soon as it's
received (through the :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_xpath`, :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_css` or
:meth:`~ItemLoader.add_value` methods) and the result of the input processor is
collected and kept inside the ItemLoader. After collecting all data, the
:meth:`ItemLoader.load_item` method is called to populate and get the populated
:class:`~scrapy.item.Item` object.  That's when the output processor is
called with the data previously collected (and processed using the input
processor). The result of the output processor is the final value that gets
assigned to the item.

Let's see an example to illustrate how the input and output processors are
called for a particular field (the same applies for any other field)::

    l = ItemLoader(Product(), some_selector)
    l.add_xpath('name', xpath1) # (1)
    l.add_xpath('name', xpath2) # (2)
    l.add_css('name', css) # (3)
    l.add_value('name', 'test') # (4)
    return l.load_item() # (5)

So what happens is:

1. Data from ``xpath1`` is extracted, and passed through the *input processor* of
   the ``name`` field. The result of the input processor is collected and kept in
   the Item Loader (but not yet assigned to the item).

2. Data from ``xpath2`` is extracted, and passed through the same *input
   processor* used in (1). The result of the input processor is appended to the
   data collected in (1) (if any).

3. This case is similar to the previous ones, except that the data is extracted
   from the ``css`` CSS selector, and passed through the same *input
   processor* used in (1) and (2). The result of the input processor is appended to the
   data collected in (1) and (2) (if any).

4. This case is also similar to the previous ones, except that the value to be
   collected is assigned directly, instead of being extracted from a XPath
   expression or a CSS selector.
   However, the value is still passed through the input processors. In this
   case, since the value is not iterable it is converted to an iterable of a
   single element before passing it to the input processor, because input
   processor always receive iterables.

5. The data collected in steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) is passed through
   the *output processor* of the ``name`` field.
   The result of the output processor is the value assigned to the ``name``
   field in the item.

It's worth noticing that processors are just callable objects, which are called
with the data to be parsed, and return a parsed value. So you can use any
function as input or output processor. The only requirement is that they must
accept one (and only one) positional argument, which will be an iterable.

.. note:: Both input and output processors must receive an iterable as their
   first argument. The output of those functions can be anything. The result of
   input processors will be appended to an internal list (in the Loader)
   containing the collected values (for that field). The result of the output
   processors is the value that will be finally assigned to the item.

The other thing you need to keep in mind is that the values returned by input
processors are collected internally (in lists) and then passed to output
processors to populate the fields.

Last, but not least, Scrapy comes with some :ref:`commonly used processors
<topics-loaders-available-processors>` built-in for convenience.



Declaring Item Loaders
======================

Item Loaders are declared like Items, by using a class definition syntax. Here
is an example::

    from scrapy.loader import ItemLoader
    from scrapy.loader.processors import TakeFirst, MapCompose, Join

    class ProductLoader(ItemLoader):

        default_output_processor = TakeFirst()

        name_in = MapCompose(unicode.title)
        name_out = Join()

        price_in = MapCompose(unicode.strip)

        # ...

As you can see, input processors are declared using the ``_in`` suffix while
output processors are declared using the ``_out`` suffix. And you can also
declare a default input/output processors using the
:attr:`ItemLoader.default_input_processor` and
:attr:`ItemLoader.default_output_processor` attributes.

.. _topics-loaders-processors-declaring:

Declaring Input and Output Processors
=====================================

As seen in the previous section, input and output processors can be declared in
the Item Loader definition, and it's very common to declare input processors
this way. However, there is one more place where you can specify the input and
output processors to use: in the :ref:`Item Field <topics-items-fields>`
metadata. Here is an example::

    import scrapy
    from scrapy.loader.processors import Join, MapCompose, TakeFirst
    from w3lib.html import remove_tags

    def filter_price(value):
        if value.isdigit():
            return value

    class Product(scrapy.Item):
        name = scrapy.Field(
            input_processor=MapCompose(remove_tags),
            output_processor=Join(),
        )
        price = scrapy.Field(
            input_processor=MapCompose(remove_tags, filter_price),
            output_processor=TakeFirst(),
        )

>>> from scrapy.loader import ItemLoader
>>> il = ItemLoader(item=Product())
>>> il.add_value('name', [u'Welcome to my', u'<strong>website</strong>'])
>>> il.add_value('price', [u'&euro;', u'<span>1000</span>'])
>>> il.load_item()
{'name': u'Welcome to my website', 'price': u'1000'}

The precedence order, for both input and output processors, is as follows:

1. Item Loader field-specific attributes: ``field_in`` and ``field_out`` (most
   precedence)
2. Field metadata (``input_processor`` and ``output_processor`` key)
3. Item Loader defaults: :meth:`ItemLoader.default_input_processor` and
   :meth:`ItemLoader.default_output_processor` (least precedence)

See also: :ref:`topics-loaders-extending`.

.. _topics-loaders-context:

Item Loader Context
===================

The Item Loader Context is a dict of arbitrary key/values which is shared among
all input and output processors in the Item Loader. It can be passed when
declaring, instantiating or using Item Loader. They are used to modify the
behaviour of the input/output processors.

For example, suppose you have a function ``parse_length`` which receives a text
value and extracts a length from it::

    def parse_length(text, loader_context):
        unit = loader_context.get('unit', 'm')
        # ... length parsing code goes here ...
        return parsed_length

By accepting a ``loader_context`` argument the function is explicitly telling
the Item Loader that it's able to receive an Item Loader context, so the Item
Loader passes the currently active context when calling it, and the processor
function (``parse_length`` in this case) can thus use them.

There are several ways to modify Item Loader context values:

1. By modifying the currently active Item Loader context
   (:attr:`~ItemLoader.context` attribute)::

      loader = ItemLoader(product)
      loader.context['unit'] = 'cm'

2. On Item Loader instantiation (the keyword arguments of Item Loader
   ``__init__`` method are stored in the Item Loader context)::

      loader = ItemLoader(product, unit='cm')

3. On Item Loader declaration, for those input/output processors that support
   instantiating them with an Item Loader context. :class:`~processor.MapCompose` is one of
   them::

       class ProductLoader(ItemLoader):
           length_out = MapCompose(parse_length, unit='cm')


ItemLoader objects
==================

.. class:: ItemLoader([item, selector, response], \**kwargs)

    Return a new Item Loader for populating the given Item. If no item is
    given, one is instantiated automatically using the class in
    :attr:`default_item_class`.

    When instantiated with a ``selector`` or a ``response`` parameters
    the :class:`ItemLoader` class provides convenient mechanisms for extracting
    data from web pages using :ref:`selectors <topics-selectors>`.

    :param item: The item instance to populate using subsequent calls to
        :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_xpath`, :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_css`,
        or :meth:`~ItemLoader.add_value`.
    :type item: :class:`~scrapy.item.Item` object

    :param selector: The selector to extract data from, when using the
        :meth:`add_xpath` (resp. :meth:`add_css`) or :meth:`replace_xpath`
        (resp. :meth:`replace_css`) method.
    :type selector: :class:`~scrapy.selector.Selector` object

    :param response: The response used to construct the selector using the
        :attr:`default_selector_class`, unless the selector argument is given,
        in which case this argument is ignored.
    :type response: :class:`~scrapy.http.Response` object

    The item, selector, response and the remaining keyword arguments are
    assigned to the Loader context (accessible through the :attr:`context` attribute).

    :class:`ItemLoader` instances have the following methods:

    .. method:: get_value(value, \*processors, \**kwargs)

        Process the given ``value`` by the given ``processors`` and keyword
        arguments.

        Available keyword arguments:

        :param re: a regular expression to use for extracting data from the
            given value using :meth:`~scrapy.utils.misc.extract_regex` method,
            applied before processors
        :type re: str or compiled regex

        Examples:

        >>> from scrapy.loader.processors import TakeFirst
        >>> loader.get_value(u'name: foo', TakeFirst(), unicode.upper, re='name: (.+)')
        'FOO`

    .. method:: add_value(field_name, value, \*processors, \**kwargs)

        Process and then add the given ``value`` for the given field.

        The value is first passed through :meth:`get_value` by giving the
        ``processors`` and ``kwargs``, and then passed through the
        :ref:`field input processor <topics-loaders-processors>` and its result
        appended to the data collected for that field. If the field already
        contains collected data, the new data is added.

        The given ``field_name`` can be ``None``, in which case values for
        multiple fields may be added. And the processed value should be a dict
        with field_name mapped to values.

        Examples::

            loader.add_value('name', u'Color TV')
            loader.add_value('colours', [u'white', u'blue'])
            loader.add_value('length', u'100')
            loader.add_value('name', u'name: foo', TakeFirst(), re='name: (.+)')
            loader.add_value(None, {'name': u'foo', 'sex': u'male'})

    .. method:: replace_value(field_name, value, \*processors, \**kwargs)

        Similar to :meth:`add_value` but replaces the collected data with the
        new value instead of adding it.
    .. method:: get_xpath(xpath, \*processors, \**kwargs)

        Similar to :meth:`ItemLoader.get_value` but receives an XPath instead of a
        value, which is used to extract a list of unicode strings from the
        selector associated with this :class:`ItemLoader`.

        :param xpath: the XPath to extract data from
        :type xpath: str

        :param re: a regular expression to use for extracting data from the
            selected XPath region
        :type re: str or compiled regex

        Examples::

            # HTML snippet: <p class="product-name">Color TV</p>
            loader.get_xpath('//p[@class="product-name"]')
            # HTML snippet: <p id="price">the price is $1200</p>
            loader.get_xpath('//p[@id="price"]', TakeFirst(), re='the price is (.*)')

    .. method:: add_xpath(field_name, xpath, \*processors, \**kwargs)

        Similar to :meth:`ItemLoader.add_value` but receives an XPath instead of a
        value, which is used to extract a list of unicode strings from the
        selector associated with this :class:`ItemLoader`.

        See :meth:`get_xpath` for ``kwargs``.

        :param xpath: the XPath to extract data from
        :type xpath: str

        Examples::

            # HTML snippet: <p class="product-name">Color TV</p>
            loader.add_xpath('name', '//p[@class="product-name"]')
            # HTML snippet: <p id="price">the price is $1200</p>
            loader.add_xpath('price', '//p[@id="price"]', re='the price is (.*)')

    .. method:: replace_xpath(field_name, xpath, \*processors, \**kwargs)

        Similar to :meth:`add_xpath` but replaces collected data instead of
        adding it.

    .. method:: get_css(css, \*processors, \**kwargs)

        Similar to :meth:`ItemLoader.get_value` but receives a CSS selector
        instead of a value, which is used to extract a list of unicode strings
        from the selector associated with this :class:`ItemLoader`.

        :param css: the CSS selector to extract data from
        :type css: str

        :param re: a regular expression to use for extracting data from the
            selected CSS region
        :type re: str or compiled regex

        Examples::

            # HTML snippet: <p class="product-name">Color TV</p>
            loader.get_css('p.product-name')
            # HTML snippet: <p id="price">the price is $1200</p>
            loader.get_css('p#price', TakeFirst(), re='the price is (.*)')

    .. method:: add_css(field_name, css, \*processors, \**kwargs)

        Similar to :meth:`ItemLoader.add_value` but receives a CSS selector
        instead of a value, which is used to extract a list of unicode strings
        from the selector associated with this :class:`ItemLoader`.

        See :meth:`get_css` for ``kwargs``.

        :param css: the CSS selector to extract data from
        :type css: str

        Examples::

            # HTML snippet: <p class="product-name">Color TV</p>
            loader.add_css('name', 'p.product-name')
            # HTML snippet: <p id="price">the price is $1200</p>
            loader.add_css('price', 'p#price', re='the price is (.*)')

    .. method:: replace_css(field_name, css, \*processors, \**kwargs)

        Similar to :meth:`add_css` but replaces collected data instead of
        adding it.

    .. method:: load_item()

        Populate the item with the data collected so far, and return it. The
        data collected is first passed through the :ref:`output processors
        <topics-loaders-processors>` to get the final value to assign to each
        item field.

    .. method:: nested_xpath(xpath)

        Create a nested loader with an xpath selector.
        The supplied selector is applied relative to selector associated
        with this :class:`ItemLoader`. The nested loader shares the :class:`Item`
        with the parent :class:`ItemLoader` so calls to :meth:`add_xpath`,
        :meth:`add_value`, :meth:`replace_value`, etc. will behave as expected.

    .. method:: nested_css(css)

        Create a nested loader with a css selector.
        The supplied selector is applied relative to selector associated
        with this :class:`ItemLoader`. The nested loader shares the :class:`Item`
        with the parent :class:`ItemLoader` so calls to :meth:`add_xpath`,
        :meth:`add_value`, :meth:`replace_value`, etc. will behave as expected.

    .. method:: get_collected_values(field_name)

        Return the collected values for the given field.

    .. method:: get_output_value(field_name)

        Return the collected values parsed using the output processor, for the
        given field. This method doesn't populate or modify the item at all.

    .. method:: get_input_processor(field_name)

        Return the input processor for the given field.

    .. method:: get_output_processor(field_name)

        Return the output processor for the given field.

    :class:`ItemLoader` instances have the following attributes:

    .. attribute:: item

        The :class:`~scrapy.item.Item` object being parsed by this Item Loader.
        This is mostly used as a property so when attempting to override this
        value, you may want to check out :attr:`default_item_class` first.

    .. attribute:: context

        The currently active :ref:`Context <topics-loaders-context>` of this
        Item Loader.

    .. attribute:: default_item_class

        An Item class (or factory), used to instantiate items when not given in
        the ``__init__`` method.

    .. attribute:: default_input_processor

        The default input processor to use for those fields which don't specify
        one.

    .. attribute:: default_output_processor

        The default output processor to use for those fields which don't specify
        one.

    .. attribute:: default_selector_class

        The class used to construct the :attr:`selector` of this
        :class:`ItemLoader`, if only a response is given in the ``__init__`` method.
        If a selector is given in the ``__init__`` method this attribute is ignored.
        This attribute is sometimes overridden in subclasses.

    .. attribute:: selector

        The :class:`~scrapy.selector.Selector` object to extract data from.
        It's either the selector given in the ``__init__`` method or one created from
        the response given in the ``__init__`` method using the
        :attr:`default_selector_class`. This attribute is meant to be
        read-only.

.. _topics-loaders-nested:

Nested Loaders
==============

When parsing related values from a subsection of a document, it can be
useful to create nested loaders.  Imagine you're extracting details from
a footer of a page that looks something like:

Example::

    <footer>
        <a class="social" href="https://facebook.com/whatever">Like Us</a>
        <a class="social" href="https://twitter.com/whatever">Follow Us</a>
        <a class="email" href="mailto:whatever@example.com">Email Us</a>
    </footer>

Without nested loaders, you need to specify the full xpath (or css) for each value
that you wish to extract.

Example::

    loader = ItemLoader(item=Item())
    # load stuff not in the footer
    loader.add_xpath('social', '//footer/a[@class = "social"]/@href')
    loader.add_xpath('email', '//footer/a[@class = "email"]/@href')
    loader.load_item()

Instead, you can create a nested loader with the footer selector and add values
relative to the footer.  The functionality is the same but you avoid repeating
the footer selector.

Example::

    loader = ItemLoader(item=Item())
    # load stuff not in the footer
    footer_loader = loader.nested_xpath('//footer')
    footer_loader.add_xpath('social', 'a[@class = "social"]/@href')
    footer_loader.add_xpath('email', 'a[@class = "email"]/@href')
    # no need to call footer_loader.load_item()
    loader.load_item()

You can nest loaders arbitrarily and they work with either xpath or css selectors.
As a general guideline, use nested loaders when they make your code simpler but do
not go overboard with nesting or your parser can become difficult to read.

.. _topics-loaders-extending:

Reusing and extending Item Loaders
==================================

As your project grows bigger and acquires more and more spiders, maintenance
becomes a fundamental problem, especially when you have to deal with many
different parsing rules for each spider, having a lot of exceptions, but also
wanting to reuse the common processors.

Item Loaders are designed to ease the maintenance burden of parsing rules,
without losing flexibility and, at the same time, providing a convenient
mechanism for extending and overriding them. For this reason Item Loaders
support traditional Python class inheritance for dealing with differences of
specific spiders (or groups of spiders).

Suppose, for example, that some particular site encloses their product names in
three dashes (e.g. ``---Plasma TV---``) and you don't want to end up scraping
those dashes in the final product names.

Here's how you can remove those dashes by reusing and extending the default
Product Item Loader (``ProductLoader``)::

    from scrapy.loader.processors import MapCompose
    from myproject.ItemLoaders import ProductLoader

    def strip_dashes(x):
        return x.strip('-')

    class SiteSpecificLoader(ProductLoader):
        name_in = MapCompose(strip_dashes, ProductLoader.name_in)

Another case where extending Item Loaders can be very helpful is when you have
multiple source formats, for example XML and HTML. In the XML version you may
want to remove ``CDATA`` occurrences. Here's an example of how to do it::

    from scrapy.loader.processors import MapCompose
    from myproject.ItemLoaders import ProductLoader
    from myproject.utils.xml import remove_cdata

    class XmlProductLoader(ProductLoader):
        name_in = MapCompose(remove_cdata, ProductLoader.name_in)

And that's how you typically extend input processors.

As for output processors, it is more common to declare them in the field metadata,
as they usually depend only on the field and not on each specific site parsing
rule (as input processors do). See also:
:ref:`topics-loaders-processors-declaring`.

There are many other possible ways to extend, inherit and override your Item
Loaders, and different Item Loaders hierarchies may fit better for different
projects. Scrapy only provides the mechanism; it doesn't impose any specific
organization of your Loaders collection - that's up to you and your project's
needs.

.. _topics-loaders-available-processors:

Available built-in processors
=============================

.. module:: scrapy.loader.processors
   :synopsis: A collection of processors to use with Item Loaders

Even though you can use any callable function as input and output processors,
Scrapy provides some commonly used processors, which are described below. Some
of them, like the :class:`MapCompose` (which is typically used as input
processor) compose the output of several functions executed in order, to
produce the final parsed value.

Here is a list of all built-in processors:

.. class:: Identity

    The simplest processor, which doesn't do anything. It returns the original
    values unchanged. It doesn't receive any ``__init__`` method arguments, nor does it
    accept Loader contexts.

    Example:

    >>> from scrapy.loader.processors import Identity
    >>> proc = Identity()
    >>> proc(['one', 'two', 'three'])
    ['one', 'two', 'three']

.. class:: TakeFirst

    Returns the first non-null/non-empty value from the values received,
    so it's typically used as an output processor to single-valued fields.
    It doesn't receive any ``__init__`` method arguments, nor does it accept Loader contexts.

    Example:

    >>> from scrapy.loader.processors import TakeFirst
    >>> proc = TakeFirst()
    >>> proc(['', 'one', 'two', 'three'])
    'one'

.. class:: Join(separator=u' ')

    Returns the values joined with the separator given in the ``__init__`` method, which
    defaults to ``u' '``. It doesn't accept Loader contexts.

    When using the default separator, this processor is equivalent to the
    function: ``u' '.join``

    Examples:

    >>> from scrapy.loader.processors import Join
    >>> proc = Join()
    >>> proc(['one', 'two', 'three'])
    'one two three'
    >>> proc = Join('<br>')
    >>> proc(['one', 'two', 'three'])
    'one<br>two<br>three'

.. class:: Compose(\*functions, \**default_loader_context)

    A processor which is constructed from the composition of the given
    functions. This means that each input value of this processor is passed to
    the first function, and the result of that function is passed to the second
    function, and so on, until the last function returns the output value of
    this processor.

    By default, stop process on ``None`` value. This behaviour can be changed by
    passing keyword argument ``stop_on_none=False``.

    Example:

    >>> from scrapy.loader.processors import Compose
    >>> proc = Compose(lambda v: v[0], str.upper)
    >>> proc(['hello', 'world'])
    'HELLO'

    Each function can optionally receive a ``loader_context`` parameter. For
    those which do, this processor will pass the currently active :ref:`Loader
    context <topics-loaders-context>` through that parameter.

    The keyword arguments passed in the ``__init__`` method are used as the default
    Loader context values passed to each function call. However, the final
    Loader context values passed to functions are overridden with the currently
    active Loader context accessible through the :meth:`ItemLoader.context`
    attribute.

.. class:: MapCompose(\*functions, \**default_loader_context)

    A processor which is constructed from the composition of the given
    functions, similar to the :class:`Compose` processor. The difference with
    this processor is the way internal results are passed among functions,
    which is as follows:

    The input value of this processor is *iterated* and the first function is
    applied to each element. The results of these function calls (one for each element)
    are concatenated to construct a new iterable, which is then used to apply the
    second function, and so on, until the last function is applied to each
    value of the list of values collected so far. The output values of the last
    function are concatenated together to produce the output of this processor.

    Each particular function can return a value or a list of values, which is
    flattened with the list of values returned by the same function applied to
    the other input values. The functions can also return ``None`` in which
    case the output of that function is ignored for further processing over the
    chain.

    This processor provides a convenient way to compose functions that only
    work with single values (instead of iterables). For this reason the
    :class:`MapCompose` processor is typically used as input processor, since
    data is often extracted using the
    :meth:`~scrapy.selector.Selector.extract` method of :ref:`selectors
    <topics-selectors>`, which returns a list of unicode strings.

    The example below should clarify how it works:

    >>> def filter_world(x):
    ...     return None if x == 'world' else x
    ...
    >>> from scrapy.loader.processors import MapCompose
    >>> proc = MapCompose(filter_world, str.upper)
    >>> proc(['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'scrapy'])
    ['HELLO, 'THIS', 'IS', 'SCRAPY']

    As with the Compose processor, functions can receive Loader contexts, and
    ``__init__`` method keyword arguments are used as default context values. See
    :class:`Compose` processor for more info.

.. class:: SelectJmes(json_path)

    Queries the value using the json path provided to the ``__init__`` method and returns the output.
    Requires jmespath (https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.py) to run.
    This processor takes only one input at a time.

    Example:

    >>> from scrapy.loader.processors import SelectJmes, Compose, MapCompose
    >>> proc = SelectJmes("foo") #for direct use on lists and dictionaries
    >>> proc({'foo': 'bar'})
    'bar'
    >>> proc({'foo': {'bar': 'baz'}})
    {'bar': 'baz'}

    Working with Json:

    >>> import json
    >>> proc_single_json_str = Compose(json.loads, SelectJmes("foo"))
    >>> proc_single_json_str('{"foo": "bar"}')
    'bar'
    >>> proc_json_list = Compose(json.loads, MapCompose(SelectJmes('foo')))
    >>> proc_json_list('[{"foo":"bar"}, {"baz":"tar"}]')
    ['bar']
