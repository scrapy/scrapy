Core API
========

This section documents the Scrapy core API, and it's intended for developers of
extensions and middlewares.

.. _topics-api-crawler:

Crawler API
===========

The main entry point to Scrapy API is the :class:`~scrapy.crawler.Crawler`
object, passed to extensions through the ``from_crawler`` class method. This
object provides access to all Scrapy core components, and it's the only way for
extensions to access them and hook their functionality into Scrapy.

.. module:: scrapy.crawler
   :synopsis: The Scrapy crawler

The Extension Manager is responsible for loading and keeping track of installed
extensions and it's configured through the :setting:`EXTENSIONS` setting which
contains a dictionary of all available extensions and their order similar to
how you :ref:`configure the downloader middlewares
<topics-downloader-middleware-setting>`.

Stats Collector API
===================

Collector API defined by the :class:`~scrapy.statscollectors.StatsCollector`
class (which they all inherit from).
