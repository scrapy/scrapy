.. _topics-commands:

=================
Command line tool
=================

.. versionadded:: 0.10

Scrapy is controlled through the ``scrapy`` command-line tool, to be referred
here as the "Scrapy tool" to differentiate it from the sub-commands, which we
just call "commands" or "Scrapy commands".

The Scrapy tool provides several commands, for multiple purposes, and each one
accepts a different set of arguments and options.

(The ``scrapy deploy`` command has been removed in 1.0 in favor of the
standalone ``scrapyd-deploy``. See `Deploying your project`_.)

.. _topics-config-settings:

Configuration settings
======================

Scrapy will look for configuration parameters in ini-style ``scrapy.cfg`` files
in standard locations:

1. ``/etc/scrapy.cfg`` or ``c:\scrapy\scrapy.cfg`` (system-wide),
2. ``~/.config/scrapy.cfg`` (``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME``) and ``~/.scrapy.cfg`` (``$HOME``)
   for global (user-wide) settings, and
3. ``scrapy.cfg`` inside a scrapy project's root (see next section).

Settings from these files are merged in the listed order of preference:
user-defined values have higher priority than system-wide defaults
and project-wide settings will override all others, when defined.

Scrapy also understands, and can be configured through, a number of environment
variables. Currently these are:

* ``SCRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE`` (see :ref:`topics-settings-module-envvar`)
* ``SCRAPY_PROJECT``
* ``SCRAPY_PYTHON_SHELL`` (see :ref:`topics-shell`)

.. _topics-project-structure:

Default structure of Scrapy projects
====================================

Before delving into the command-line tool and its sub-commands, let's first
understand the directory structure of a Scrapy project.

Though it can be modified, all Scrapy projects have the same file
structure by default, similar to this::

   scrapy.cfg
   myproject/
       __init__.py
       items.py
       pipelines.py
       settings.py
       spiders/
           __init__.py
           spider1.py
           spider2.py
           ...

The directory where the ``scrapy.cfg`` file resides is known as the *project
root directory*. That file contains the name of the python module that defines
the project settings. Here is an example::

    [settings]
    default = myproject.settings

Using the ``scrapy`` tool
=========================

You can start by running the Scrapy tool with no arguments and it will print
some usage help and the available commands::

    Scrapy X.Y - no active project

    Usage:
      scrapy <command> [options] [args]

    Available commands:
      crawl         Run a spider
      fetch         Fetch a URL using the Scrapy downloader
    [...]

The first line will print the currently active project if you're inside a
Scrapy project. In this example it was run from outside a project. If run from inside
a project it would have printed something like this::

    Scrapy X.Y - project: myproject

    Usage:
      scrapy <command> [options] [args]

    [...]

Creating projects
-----------------

The first thing you typically do with the ``scrapy`` tool is create your Scrapy
project::

    scrapy startproject myproject [project_dir]

That will create a Scrapy project under the ``project_dir`` directory.
If ``project_dir`` wasn't specified, ``project_dir`` will be the same as ``myproject``.

Next, you go inside the new project directory::

    cd project_dir

And you're ready to use the ``scrapy`` command to manage and control your
project from there.

Controlling projects
--------------------

You use the ``scrapy`` tool from inside your projects to control and manage
them.

For example, to create a new spider::

    scrapy genspider mydomain mydomain.com

Some Scrapy commands (like :command:`crawl`) must be run from inside a Scrapy
project. See the :ref:`commands reference <topics-commands-ref>` below for more
information on which commands must be run from inside projects, and which not.

Also keep in mind that some commands may have slightly different behaviours
when running them from inside projects. For example, the fetch command will use
spider-overridden behaviours (such as the ``user_agent`` attribute to override
the user-agent) if the url being fetched is associated with some specific
spider. This is intentional, as the ``fetch`` command is meant to be used to
check how spiders are downloading pages.

.. _topics-commands-ref:

Available tool commands
=======================

This section contains a list of the available built-in commands with a
description and some usage examples. Remember, you can always get more info
about each command by running::

    scrapy <command> -h

And you can see all available commands with::

    scrapy -h

There are two kinds of commands, those that only work from inside a Scrapy
project (Project-specific commands) and those that also work without an active
Scrapy project (Global commands), though they may behave slightly different
when running from inside a project (as they would use the project overridden
settings).

Global commands:

* :command:`startproject`
* :command:`genspider`
* :command:`settings`
* :command:`runspider`
* :command:`shell`
* :command:`fetch`
* :command:`view`
* :command:`version`

Project-only commands:

* :command:`crawl`
* :command:`check`
* :command:`list`
* :command:`edit`
* :command:`parse`
* :command:`bench`

.. command:: startproject

startproject
------------

* Syntax: ``scrapy startproject <project_name> [project_dir]``
* Requires project: *no*

Creates a new Scrapy project named ``project_name``, under the ``project_dir``
directory.
If ``project_dir`` wasn't specified, ``project_dir`` will be the same as ``myproject``.

Usage example::

    $ scrapy startproject myproject

.. command:: genspider

genspider
---------

* Syntax: ``scrapy genspider [-t template] <name> <domain>``
* Requires project: *no*

Create a new spider in the current folder or in the current project's ``spiders`` folder, if called from inside a project. The ``<name>`` parameter is set as the spider's ``name``, while ``<domain>`` is used to generate the ``allowed_domains`` and ``start_urls`` spider's attributes.

Usage example::

    $ scrapy genspider -l
    Available templates:
      basic
      crawl
      csvfeed
      xmlfeed

    $ scrapy genspider example example.com
    Created spider 'example' using template 'basic'

    $ scrapy genspider -t crawl scrapyorg scrapy.org
    Created spider 'scrapyorg' using template 'crawl'

This is just a convenience shortcut command for creating spiders based on
pre-defined templates, but certainly not the only way to create spiders. You
can just create the spider source code files yourself, instead of using this
command.

.. command:: crawl

crawl
-----

* Syntax: ``scrapy crawl <spider>``
* Requires project: *yes*

Start crawling using a spider.

Usage examples::

    $ scrapy crawl myspider
    [ ... myspider starts crawling ... ]


.. command:: check

check
-----

* Syntax: ``scrapy check [-l] <spider>``
* Requires project: *yes*

Run contract checks.

Usage examples::

    $ scrapy check -l
    first_spider
      * parse
      * parse_item
    second_spider
      * parse
      * parse_item

    $ scrapy check
    [FAILED] first_spider:parse_item
    >>> 'RetailPricex' field is missing

    [FAILED] first_spider:parse
    >>> Returned 92 requests, expected 0..4

.. command:: list

list
----

* Syntax: ``scrapy list``
* Requires project: *yes*

List all available spiders in the current project. The output is one spider per
line.

Usage example::

    $ scrapy list
    spider1
    spider2

.. command:: edit

edit
----

* Syntax: ``scrapy edit <spider>``
* Requires project: *yes*

Edit the given spider using the editor defined in the :setting:`EDITOR`
setting.

This command is provided only as a convenience shortcut for the most common
case, the developer is of course free to choose any tool or IDE to write and
debug his spiders.

Usage example::

    $ scrapy edit spider1

.. command:: fetch

fetch
-----

* Syntax: ``scrapy fetch <url>``
* Requires project: *no*

Downloads the given URL using the Scrapy downloader and writes the contents to
standard output.

The interesting thing about this command is that it fetches the page how the
spider would download it. For example, if the spider has a ``USER_AGENT``
attribute which overrides the User Agent, it will use that one.

So this command can be used to "see" how your spider would fetch a certain page.

If used outside a project, no particular per-spider behaviour would be applied
and it will just use the default Scrapy downloader settings.

Usage examples::

    $ scrapy fetch --nolog http://www.example.com/some/page.html
    [ ... html content here ... ]

    $ scrapy fetch --nolog --headers http://www.example.com/
    {'Accept-Ranges': ['bytes'],
     'Age': ['1263   '],
     'Connection': ['close     '],
     'Content-Length': ['596'],
     'Content-Type': ['text/html; charset=UTF-8'],
     'Date': ['Wed, 18 Aug 2010 23:59:46 GMT'],
     'Etag': ['"573c1-254-48c9c87349680"'],
     'Last-Modified': ['Fri, 30 Jul 2010 15:30:18 GMT'],
     'Server': ['Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)']}

.. command:: view

view
----

* Syntax: ``scrapy view <url>``
* Requires project: *no*

Opens the given URL in a browser, as your Scrapy spider would "see" it.
Sometimes spiders see pages differently from regular users, so this can be used
to check what the spider "sees" and confirm it's what you expect.

Usage example::

    $ scrapy view http://www.example.com/some/page.html
    [ ... browser starts ... ]

.. command:: shell

shell
-----

* Syntax: ``scrapy shell [url]``
* Requires project: *no*

Starts the Scrapy shell for the given URL (if given) or empty if no URL is
given. Also supports UNIX-style local file paths, either relative with
``./`` or ``../`` prefixes or absolute file paths.
See :ref:`topics-shell` for more info.

Usage example::

    $ scrapy shell http://www.example.com/some/page.html
    [ ... scrapy shell starts ... ]

.. command:: parse

parse
-----

* Syntax: ``scrapy parse <url> [options]``
* Requires project: *yes*

Fetches the given URL and parses it with the spider that handles it, using the
method passed with the ``--callback`` option, or ``parse`` if not given.

Supported options:

* ``--spider=SPIDER``: bypass spider autodetection and force use of specific spider

* ``--a NAME=VALUE``: set spider argument (may be repeated)

* ``--callback`` or ``-c``: spider method to use as callback for parsing the
  response

* ``--pipelines``: process items through pipelines

* ``--rules`` or ``-r``: use :class:`~scrapy.spiders.CrawlSpider`
  rules to discover the callback (i.e. spider method) to use for parsing the
  response

* ``--noitems``: don't show scraped items

* ``--nolinks``: don't show extracted links

* ``--nocolour``: avoid using pygments to colorize the output

* ``--depth`` or ``-d``: depth level for which the requests should be followed
  recursively (default: 1)

* ``--verbose`` or ``-v``: display information for each depth level

Usage example::

    $ scrapy parse http://www.example.com/ -c parse_item
    [ ... scrapy log lines crawling example.com spider ... ]

    >>> STATUS DEPTH LEVEL 1 <<<
    # Scraped Items  ------------------------------------------------------------
    [{'name': u'Example item',
     'category': u'Furniture',
     'length': u'12 cm'}]

    # Requests  -----------------------------------------------------------------
    []


.. command:: settings

settings
--------

* Syntax: ``scrapy settings [options]``
* Requires project: *no*

Get the value of a Scrapy setting.

If used inside a project it'll show the project setting value, otherwise it'll
show the default Scrapy value for that setting.

Example usage::

    $ scrapy settings --get BOT_NAME
    scrapybot
    $ scrapy settings --get DOWNLOAD_DELAY
    0

.. command:: runspider

runspider
---------

* Syntax: ``scrapy runspider <spider_file.py>``
* Requires project: *no*

Run a spider self-contained in a Python file, without having to create a
project.

Example usage::

    $ scrapy runspider myspider.py
    [ ... spider starts crawling ... ]

.. command:: version

version
-------

* Syntax: ``scrapy version [-v]``
* Requires project: *no*

Prints the Scrapy version. If used with ``-v`` it also prints Python, Twisted
and Platform info, which is useful for bug reports.

.. command:: bench

bench
-----

.. versionadded:: 0.17

* Syntax: ``scrapy bench``
* Requires project: *no*

Run a quick benchmark test. :ref:`benchmarking`.

Custom project commands
=======================

You can also add your custom project commands by using the
:setting:`COMMANDS_MODULE` setting. See the Scrapy commands in
`scrapy/commands`_ for examples on how to implement your commands.

.. _scrapy/commands: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/tree/master/scrapy/commands
.. setting:: COMMANDS_MODULE

COMMANDS_MODULE
---------------

Default: ``''`` (empty string)

A module to use for looking up custom Scrapy commands. This is used to add custom
commands for your Scrapy project.

Example::

    COMMANDS_MODULE = 'mybot.commands'

.. _Deploying your project: http://scrapyd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/deploy.html

Register commands via setup.py entry points
-------------------------------------------

.. note:: This is an experimental feature, use with caution.

You can also add Scrapy commands from an external library by adding a
``scrapy.commands`` section in the entry points of the library ``setup.py``
file.

The following example adds ``my_command`` command::

  from setuptools import setup, find_packages

  setup(name='scrapy-mymodule',
    entry_points={
      'scrapy.commands': [
        'my_command=my_scrapy_module.commands:MyCommand',
      ],
    },
   )
