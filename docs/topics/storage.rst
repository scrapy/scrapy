Storage
=======

The storage functionality can be used to store information locally or globally based on the events of opening and closing a spider. The original purpose of having the storage functionality is to be able to handle the cookie storage across spiders, however this can be extended for other purposes.

BaseStorage
===========

BaseStorage is the interface of the storage class that defines how an implemented storage should behave. The main methods are the following:

   .. method:: open_spider(spdr)

	This method is called upon the event of a spider being opened.

	:param spider: the spider that is being opened
	:type spider: :class:`~scrapy.Spider` object

   .. method:: close_spider(spdr)

	This method is called upon the event of a spider being closed.

	:param spider: the spider that is being closed
	:type spider: :class:`~scrapy.Spider` object

InMemoryStorage
===============

The InMemoryStorage is designed to allow the storage of cookies on a local file. If the COOKIES_PERSISTENCE constant is set to true in the settings of the project, the cookies are saved to a file and loaded from it on demand.

   .. method:: open_spider(spider)

	This method is called upon the event of a spider being opened. When the spider is opened, the cookies are loaded from the file, if they were saved there by a spider from a previous crawling session.

	:param spider: the spider that is being opened
	:type spider: :class:`~scrapy.Spider` object

   .. method:: close_spider(spider)

	This method is called upon the event of a spider being closed. When the spider is closed, the cookies are saved to the file in order to allow another spider to reuse those existing cookies at a later point in time.

	:param spider: the spider that is being closed
	:type spider: :class:`~scrapy.Spider` object
