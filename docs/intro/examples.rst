The best way to learn is with examples, and Scrapy is no exception. For this
reason, there is an example Scrapy project named dirbot_, that you can use to
play and learn more about Scrapy. It contains the dmoz spider described in the
tutorial.

This dirbot_ project is available at: https://github.com/scrapy/dirbot

It contains a README file with a detailed description of the project contents.

If you're familiar with git, you can checkout the code. Otherwise you can
download a tarball or zip file of the project by clicking on `Downloads`_.

The `scrapy tag on Snipplr`_ is used for sharing code snippets such as spiders,
middlewares, extensions, or scripts. Feel free (and encouraged!) to share any
code there.
