Cover your bases
================

If you are experiencing issues while using Scrapy, or cannot install Scrapy at
all, make sure you have followed the installation steps described in the
:ref:`intro-install`, including :ref:`platform-specific steps
<intro-install-platform-notes>`. Also remember to check out its
:ref:`troubleshooting section <intro-install-troubleshooting>`.

If you have a question about Scrapy, try to get familiar with Scrapy first.
:ref:`section-first-steps` pages will help you get started quickly.
:ref:`section-basics` pages will solve most basic questions about Scrapy.

If you have questions beyond the basics, or you are experiencing issues while
using Scrapy, start by reading the :ref:`faq` page, which covers common
questions and issues.

If you are not sure how to solve a specific problem with Scrapy,
:ref:`section-solving-problems` pages cover solutions for common problems.

You can also search the documentation, or check the
:ref:`genindex` or the :ref:`modindex`.


Are you first?
==============

Whatever your question or issue, there is a chance someone else has been in
your shoes before. Search for similar topics in StackOverflow_, reddit_, the
old `mailing list`_ or the `issue tracker`_.


Ask away
========

If you cannot find an answer or a solution for your problem, you can try to get
help from the Scrapy community:

*   If you think you have found a bug in Scrapy, please submit a bug report on
    our `issue tracker`_.

*   If you want to start a discussion related to Scrapy, and you are not
