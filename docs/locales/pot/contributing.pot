#: ../../contributing.rst:123
msgid "You can also discuss the new functionality (or bug fix) before creating the patch, but it's always good to have a patch ready to illustrate your arguments and show that you have put some additional thought into the subject. A good starting point is to send a pull request on GitHub. It can be simple enough to illustrate your idea, and leave documentation/tests for later, after the idea has been validated and proven useful. Alternatively, you can start a conversation in the `Scrapy subreddit`_ to discuss your idea first."

msgid "Sometimes there is an existing pull request for the problem you'd like to solve, which is stalled for some reason. Often the pull request is in a right direction, but changes are requested by Scrapy maintainers, and the original pull request author hasn't had time to address them. In this case consider picking up this pull request: open a new pull request with all commits from the original pull request, as well as additional changes to address the raised issues. Doing so helps a lot; it is not considered rude as soon as the original author is acknowledged by keeping his/her commits."

Complete titles make it easy to skim through the issue tracker."
