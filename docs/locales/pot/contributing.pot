#: ../../contributing.rst:123
msgid "You can also discuss the new functionality (or bug fix) before creating the patch, but it's always good to have a patch ready to illustrate your arguments and show that you have put some additional thought into the subject. A good starting point is to send a pull request on GitHub. It can be simple enough to illustrate your idea, and leave documentation/tests for later, after the idea has been validated and proven useful. Alternatively, you can start a conversation in the `Scrapy subreddit`_ to discuss your idea first."

#: ../../contributing.rst:131
msgid "Sometimes there is an existing pull request for the problem you'd like to solve, which is stalled for some reason. Often the pull request is in a right direction, but changes are requested by Scrapy maintainers, and the original pull request author hasn't had time to address them. In this case consider picking up this pull request: open a new pull request with all commits from the original pull request, as well as additional changes to address the raised issues. Doing so helps a lot; it is not considered rude as soon as the original author is acknowledged by keeping his/her commits."

Complete titles make it easy to skim through the issue tracker."
