In other words, the :meth:`~scrapy.spidermiddlewares.SpiderMiddleware.process_spider_input` method of each middleware will be invoked in increasing middleware order (100, 200, 300, ...), and the :meth:`~scrapy.spidermiddlewares.SpiderMiddleware.process_spider_output` method of each middleware will be invoked in decreasing order."
