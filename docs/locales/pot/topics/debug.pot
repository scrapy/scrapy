msgid "This document explains the most common techniques for debugging spiders. Consider the following Scrapy spider below::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/debug.rst:37
msgid "Basically this is a simple spider which parses two pages of items (the start_urls). Items also have a details page with additional information, so we use the ``cb_kwargs`` functionality of :class:`~scrapy.http.Request` to pass a partially populated item."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parse Command"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/debug.rst:46
msgid "The most basic way of checking the output of your spider is to use the :command:`parse` command. It allows to check the behaviour of different parts of the spider at the method level. It has the advantage of being flexible and simple to use, but does not allow debugging code inside a method."

msgid "In order to see the item scraped from a specific url::"

msgid "Using the ``--verbose`` or ``-v`` option we can see the status at each depth level::"

msgid "Scrapy Shell"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/debug.rst:98
msgid "While the :command:`parse` command is very useful for checking behaviour of a spider, it is of little help to check what happens inside a callback, besides showing the response received and the output. How to debug the situation when ``parse_details`` sometimes receives no item?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/debug.rst:105
msgid "Fortunately, the :command:`shell` is your bread and butter in this case (see :ref:`topics-shell-inspect-response`)::"

#: ../../topics/debug.rst:122
msgid "Sometimes you just want to see how a certain response looks in a browser, you can use the ``open_in_browser`` function for that. Here is an example of how you would use it::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/debug.rst:132
msgid "``open_in_browser`` will open a browser with the response received by Scrapy at that point, adjusting the `base tag`_ so that images and styles are displayed properly."

msgid "Logging"
