#: ../../topics/shell.rst:7
msgid "The Scrapy shell is an interactive shell where you can try and debug your scraping code very quickly, without having to run the spider. It's meant to be used for testing data extraction code, but you can actually use it for testing any kind of code as it is also a regular Python shell."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:12
msgid "The shell is used for testing XPath or CSS expressions and see how they work and what data they extract from the web pages you're trying to scrape. It allows you to interactively test your expressions while you're writing your spider, without having to run the spider to test every change."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:17
msgid "Once you get familiarized with the Scrapy shell, you'll see that it's an invaluable tool for developing and debugging your spiders."

msgid "Configuring the shell"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:23
msgid "If you have `IPython`_ installed, the Scrapy shell will use it (instead of the standard Python console). The `IPython`_ console is much more powerful and provides smart auto-completion and colorized output, among other things."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:27
msgid "We highly recommend you install `IPython`_, specially if you're working on Unix systems (where `IPython`_ excels). See the `IPython installation guide`_ for more info."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:31
msgid "Scrapy also has support for `bpython`_, and will try to use it where `IPython`_ is unavailable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:34
msgid "Through Scrapy's settings you can configure it to use any one of ``ipython``, ``bpython`` or the standard ``python`` shell, regardless of which are installed. This is done by setting the ``SCRAPY_PYTHON_SHELL`` environment variable; or by defining it in your :ref:`scrapy.cfg <topics-config-settings>`::"

msgid "Launch the shell"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:49
msgid "To launch the Scrapy shell you can use the :command:`shell` command like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:54
msgid "Where the ``<url>`` is the URL you want to scrape."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:56
msgid ":command:`shell` also works for local files. This can be handy if you want to play around with a local copy of a web page. :command:`shell` understands the following syntaxes for local files::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:68
msgid "When using relative file paths, be explicit and prepend them with ``./`` (or ``../`` when relevant). ``scrapy shell index.html`` will not work as one might expect (and this is by design, not a bug)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:73
msgid "Because :command:`shell` favors HTTP URLs over File URIs, and ``index.html`` being syntactically similar to ``example.com``, :command:`shell` will treat ``index.html`` as a domain name and trigger a DNS lookup error::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:84
msgid ":command:`shell` will not test beforehand if a file called ``index.html`` exists in the current directory. Again, be explicit."

msgid "Using the shell"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:91
msgid "The Scrapy shell is just a regular Python console (or `IPython`_ console if you have it available) which provides some additional shortcut functions for convenience."

msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:104
msgid "``fetch(request)`` - fetch a new response from the given request and update all related objects accordingly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:107
msgid "``view(response)`` - open the given response in your local web browser, for inspection. This will add a `\\<base\\> tag`_ to the response body in order for external links (such as images and style sheets) to display properly. Note, however, that this will create a temporary file in your computer, which won't be removed automatically."

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:144
msgid "Here's an example of a typical shell session where we start by scraping the https://scrapy.org page, and then proceed to scrape the https://old.reddit.com/ page. Finally, we modify the (Reddit) request method to POST and re-fetch it getting an error. We end the session by typing Ctrl-D (in Unix systems) or Ctrl-Z in Windows."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:150
msgid "Keep in mind that the data extracted here may not be the same when you try it, as those pages are not static and could have changed by the time you test this. The only purpose of this example is to get you familiarized with how the Scrapy shell works."

msgid "First, we launch the shell::"

msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:254

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:265
msgid "Then, you can check if the extraction code is working:"

msgid "Nope, it doesn't. So you can open the response in your web browser and see if it's the response you were expecting:"

msgid "Finally you hit Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-Z in Windows) to exit the shell and resume the crawling::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/shell.rst:283
msgid "Note that you can't use the ``fetch`` shortcut here since the Scrapy engine is blocked by the shell. However, after you leave the shell, the spider will continue crawling where it stopped, as shown above."
