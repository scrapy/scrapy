msgid "Run Scrapy from a script"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:15
msgid "You can use the :ref:`API <topics-api>` to run Scrapy from a script, instead of the typical way of running Scrapy via ``scrapy crawl``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:18
msgid "Remember that Scrapy is built on top of the Twisted asynchronous networking library, so you need to run it inside the Twisted reactor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:21
msgid "The first utility you can use to run your spiders is :class:`scrapy.crawler.CrawlerProcess`. This class will start a Twisted reactor for you, configuring the logging and setting shutdown handlers. This class is the one used by all Scrapy commands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:26
msgid "Here's an example showing how to run a single spider with it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:45
msgid "Define settings within dictionary in CrawlerProcess. Make sure to check :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerProcess` documentation to get acquainted with its usage details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:48
msgid "If you are inside a Scrapy project there are some additional helpers you can use to import those components within the project. You can automatically import your spiders passing their name to :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerProcess`, and use ``get_project_settings`` to get a :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` instance with your project settings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:54
msgid "What follows is a working example of how to do that, using the `testspiders`_ project as example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:68
msgid "There's another Scrapy utility that provides more control over the crawling process: :class:`scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner`. This class is a thin wrapper that encapsulates some simple helpers to run multiple crawlers, but it won't start or interfere with existing reactors in any way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:73
msgid "Using this class the reactor should be explicitly run after scheduling your spiders. It's recommended you use :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` instead of :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerProcess` if your application is already using Twisted and you want to run Scrapy in the same reactor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:78
msgid "Note that you will also have to shutdown the Twisted reactor yourself after the spider is finished. This can be achieved by adding callbacks to the deferred returned by the :meth:`CrawlerRunner.crawl <scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner.crawl>` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:83
msgid "Here's an example of its usage, along with a callback to manually stop the reactor after ``MySpider`` has finished running."

msgid "Running multiple spiders in the same process"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:111
msgid "By default, Scrapy runs a single spider per process when you run ``scrapy crawl``. However, Scrapy supports running multiple spiders per process using the :ref:`internal API <topics-api>`."

msgid "Distributed crawls"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:196
msgid "Scrapy doesn't provide any built-in facility for running crawls in a distribute (multi-server) manner. However, there are some ways to distribute crawls, which vary depending on how you plan to distribute them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:200
msgid "If you have many spiders, the obvious way to distribute the load is to setup many Scrapyd instances and distribute spider runs among those."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:203
msgid "If you instead want to run a single (big) spider through many machines, what you usually do is partition the urls to crawl and send them to each separate spider. Here is a concrete example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:207
msgid "First, you prepare the list of urls to crawl and put them into separate files/urls::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:214
msgid "Then you fire a spider run on 3 different Scrapyd servers. The spider would receive a (spider) argument ``part`` with the number of the partition to crawl::"

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:227
msgid "Some websites implement certain measures to prevent bots from crawling them, with varying degrees of sophistication. Getting around those measures can be difficult and tricky, and may sometimes require special infrastructure. Please consider contacting `commercial support`_ if in doubt."

msgid "Here are some tips to keep in mind when dealing with these kinds of sites:"

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:234
msgid "rotate your user agent from a pool of well-known ones from browsers (google around to get a list of them)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:236
msgid "disable cookies (see :setting:`COOKIES_ENABLED`) as some sites may use cookies to spot bot behaviour"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:238
msgid "use download delays (2 or higher). See :setting:`DOWNLOAD_DELAY` setting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:239
msgid "if possible, use `Google cache`_ to fetch pages, instead of hitting the sites directly"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:241
msgid "use a pool of rotating IPs. For example, the free `Tor project`_ or paid services like `ProxyMesh`_. An open source alternative is `scrapoxy`_, a super proxy that you can attach your own proxies to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/practices.rst:244
msgid "use a highly distributed downloader that circumvents bans internally, so you can just focus on parsing clean pages. One example of such downloaders is `Crawlera`_"
