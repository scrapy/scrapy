"In Scrapy, objects such as Requests, Responses and Items have a finite "
"lifetime: they are created, used for a while, and finally destroyed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/leaks.rst:10
msgid ""
"From all those objects, the Request is probably the one with the longest "
"lifetime, as it stays waiting in the Scheduler queue until it's time to "
"process it. For more info see :ref:`topics-architecture`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/leaks.rst:14
msgid ""
"As these Scrapy objects have a (rather long) lifetime, there is always "
"the risk of accumulating them in memory without releasing them properly "
"and thus causing what is known as a \"memory leak\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/leaks.rst:18
msgid ""
"To help debugging memory leaks, Scrapy provides a built-in mechanism for "
"tracking objects references called :ref:`trackref <topics-leaks-"
"trackrefs>`, and you can also use a third-party library called "
":ref:`Guppy <topics-leaks-guppy>` for more advanced memory debugging (see"
" below for more info). Both mechanisms must be used from the :ref:`Telnet"
" Console <topics-telnetconsole>`."

msgid "Common causes of memory leaks"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/leaks.rst:28
msgid ""
"It happens quite often (sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose) that"
" the Scrapy developer passes objects referenced in Requests (for example,"
" using the :attr:`~scrapy.http.Request.cb_kwargs` or "
":attr:`~scrapy.http.Request.meta` attributes or the request callback "
"function) and that effectively bounds the lifetime of those referenced "
"objects to the lifetime of the Request. This is, by far, the most common "
"cause of memory leaks in Scrapy projects, and a quite difficult one to "
"debug for newcomers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/leaks.rst:36
msgid ""
"In big projects, the spiders are typically written by different people "
"and some of those spiders could be \"leaking\" and thus affecting the "
"rest of the other (well-written) spiders when they get to run "
"concurrently, which, in turn, affects the whole crawling process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/leaks.rst:41
msgid ""
"The leak could also come from a custom middleware, pipeline or extension "
"that you have written, if you are not releasing the (previously "
"allocated) resources properly. For example, allocating resources on "
":signal:`spider_opened` but not releasing them on :signal:`spider_closed`"
" may cause problems if you're running :ref:`multiple spiders per process "
"<run-multiple-spiders>`."

"Request attributes (e.g. in :attr:`~scrapy.http.Request.cb_kwargs` and "

"can take a lot of memory. Enabling :ref:`persistent job queue <topics-"

"The fact that there are so many live responses (and that they're so old) "
"is definitely suspicious, as responses should have a relatively short "
"lifetime compared to Requests. The number of responses is similar to the "
"number of requests, so it looks like they are tied in a some way. We can "
