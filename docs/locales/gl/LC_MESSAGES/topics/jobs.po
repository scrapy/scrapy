"To enable persistence support you just need to define a *job directory* "
"through the ``JOBDIR`` setting. This directory will be for storing all "
"required data to keep the state of a single job (i.e. a spider run).  "
"It's important to note that this directory must not be shared by "
"different spiders, or even different jobs/runs of the same spider, as "

"Sometimes you'll want to keep some persistent spider state between "
