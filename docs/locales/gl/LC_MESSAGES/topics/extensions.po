"Extensions use the :ref:`Scrapy settings <topics-settings>` to manage "
"their settings, just like any other Scrapy code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/extensions.rst:19
msgid ""
"It is customary for extensions to prefix their settings with their own "
"name, to avoid collision with existing (and future) extensions. For "
"example, a hypothetic extension to handle `Google Sitemaps`_ would use "
"settings like ``GOOGLESITEMAP_ENABLED``, ``GOOGLESITEMAP_DEPTH``, and so "
"on."

"Extensions are loaded and activated at startup by instantiating a single "
"instance of the extension class. Therefore, all the extension "
"initialization code must be performed in the class ``__init__`` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/extensions.rst:33
msgid ""
"To make an extension available, add it to the :setting:`EXTENSIONS` "
"setting in your Scrapy settings. In :setting:`EXTENSIONS`, each extension"
" is represented by a string: the full Python path to the extension's "
"class name. For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/extensions.rst:43
msgid ""
"As you can see, the :setting:`EXTENSIONS` setting is a dict where the "
"keys are the extension paths, and their values are the orders, which "
"define the extension *loading* order. The :setting:`EXTENSIONS` setting "
"is merged with the :setting:`EXTENSIONS_BASE` setting defined in Scrapy "
"(and not meant to be overridden) and then sorted by order to get the "
"final sorted list of enabled extensions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/extensions.rst:50
msgid ""
"As extensions typically do not depend on each other, their loading order "
"is irrelevant in most cases. This is why the :setting:`EXTENSIONS_BASE` "
"setting defines all extensions with the same order (``0``). However, this"
" feature can be exploited if you need to add an extension which depends "
"on other extensions already loaded."

"Each extension is a Python class. The main entry point for a Scrapy "

"Through the Crawler object you can access settings, signals, stats, and "
"also control the crawling behaviour."
