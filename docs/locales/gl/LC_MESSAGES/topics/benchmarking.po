"Scrapy comes with a simple benchmarking suite that spawns a local HTTP "
"server and crawls it at the maximum possible speed. The goal of this "
"benchmarking is to get an idea of how Scrapy performs in your hardware, "
"in order to have a common baseline for comparisons. It uses a simple "
"spider that does nothing and just follows links."

"That tells you that Scrapy is able to crawl about 3000 pages per minute "
"in the hardware where you run it. Note that this is a very simple spider "
"intended to follow links, any custom spider you write will probably do "
"more stuff which results in slower crawl rates. How slower depends on how"
" much your spider does and how well it's written."
