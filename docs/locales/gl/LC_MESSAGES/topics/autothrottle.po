"This is an extension for automatically throttling crawling speed based on"
" load of both the Scrapy server and the website you are crawling."

msgid ""
"automatically adjust Scrapy to the optimum crawling speed, so the user "
"doesn't have to tune the download delays to find the optimum one. The "
"user only needs to specify the maximum concurrent requests it allows, and"
" the extension does the rest."

msgid "How it works"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/autothrottle.rst:24
msgid ""
"AutoThrottle extension adjusts download delays dynamically to make spider"
" send :setting:`AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY` concurrent requests on "
"average to each remote website."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/autothrottle.rst:28
msgid ""
"It uses download latency to compute the delays. The main idea is the "
"following: if a server needs ``latency`` seconds to respond, a client "
"should send a request each ``latency/N`` seconds to have ``N`` requests "
"processed in parallel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/autothrottle.rst:33
msgid ""
"Instead of adjusting the delays one can just set a small fixed download "
"delay and impose hard limits on concurrency using "
":setting:`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN` or "
":setting:`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP` options. It will provide a similar "
"effect, but there are some important differences:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/autothrottle.rst:39
msgid ""
"because the download delay is small there will be occasional bursts of "
"requests;"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/autothrottle.rst:41
msgid ""
"often non-200 (error) responses can be returned faster than regular "
"responses, so with a small download delay and a hard concurrency limit "
"crawler will be sending requests to server faster when server starts to "
"return errors. But this is an opposite of what crawler should do - in "
"case of errors it makes more sense to slow down: these errors may be "
"caused by the high request rate."

"The AutoThrottle extension honours the standard Scrapy settings for "
"concurrency and delay. This means that it will respect "
":setting:`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN` and "

"In Scrapy, the download latency is measured as the time elapsed between "
"establishing the TCP connection and receiving the HTTP headers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/autothrottle.rst:77
msgid ""
"Note that these latencies are very hard to measure accurately in a "
"cooperative multitasking environment because Scrapy may be busy "
"processing a spider callback, for example, and unable to attend "
"downloads. However, these latencies should still give a reasonable "
"estimate of how busy Scrapy (and ultimately, the server) is, and this "
"extension builds on that premise."
