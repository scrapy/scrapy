"Scrapy provides a convenient facility for collecting stats in the form of"
" key/values, where values are often counters. The facility is called the "
"Stats Collector, and can be accessed through the "
":attr:`~scrapy.crawler.Crawler.stats` attribute of the :ref:`topics-api-"
"crawler`, as illustrated by the examples in the :ref:`topics-stats-"
"usecases` section below."

"However, the Stats Collector is always available, so you can always "
"import it in your module and use its API (to increment or set new stat "
"keys), regardless of whether the stats collection is enabled or not. If "
"it's disabled, the API will still work but it won't collect anything. "
"This is aimed at simplifying the stats collector usage: you should spend "
"no more than one line of code for collecting stats in your spider, Scrapy"
" extension, or whatever code you're using the Stats Collector from."

#: ../../topics/stats.rst:21

"Another feature of the Stats Collector is that it's very efficient (when "
"enabled) and extremely efficient (almost unnoticeable) when disabled."

"The Stats Collector keeps a stats table per open spider which is "

"A simple stats collector that keeps the stats of the last scraping run "

"A Stats collector which does nothing but is very efficient (because it "
