class Scheduler(BaseScheduler):
    """Default scheduler.

    Requests are stored into priority queues
    (:setting:`SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_QUEUE`) that sort requests by
    :attr:`~scrapy.http.Request.priority`.

    By default, a single, memory-based priority queue is used for all requests.
    When using :setting:`JOBDIR`, a disk-based priority queue is also created,
    and only unserializable requests are stored in the memory-based priority
    queue. For a given priority value, requests in memory take precedence over
    requests in disk.

    Each priority queue stores requests in separate internal queues, one per
    priority value. The memory priority queue uses
    :setting:`SCHEDULER_MEMORY_QUEUE` queues, while the disk priority queue
    uses :setting:`SCHEDULER_DISK_QUEUE` queues. The internal queues determine
    :ref:`request order <request-order>` when requests have the same priority.
    :ref:`Start requests <start-requests>` are stored into separate internal
    queues by default, and :ref:`ordered differently <start-request-order>`.

    Duplicate requests are filtered out with an instance of
    :setting:`DUPEFILTER_CLASS`.

    .. _request-order:

    Request order
    =============

    With default settings, pending requests are stored in a LIFO_ queue
    (:ref:`except for start requests <start-request-order>`). As a result,
    crawling happens in `DFO order`_, which is usually the most convenient
    crawl order. However, you can enforce :ref:`BFO <bfo>` or :ref:`a custom
    order <custom-request-order>` (:ref:`except for the first few requests
    <concurrency-v-order>`).

    .. _LIFO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)
    .. _DFO order: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search

    .. _start-request-order:

    Start request order
    -------------------

    :ref:`Start requests <start-requests>` are sent in the order they are
    yielded from :meth:`~scrapy.Spider.start`, and given the same
    :attr:`~scrapy.http.Request.priority`, start requests take precedence over
    other requests.

    You can set :setting:`SCHEDULER_START_MEMORY_QUEUE` and
    :setting:`SCHEDULER_START_DISK_QUEUE` to ``None`` to handle start requests
    the same as other requests when it comes to order and priority.


    .. _bfo:

    Crawling in BFO order
    ---------------------

    If you do want to crawl in `BFO order`_, you can do it by setting the
    following :ref:`settings <topics-settings>`:

    | :setting:`DEPTH_PRIORITY` = ``1``
    | :setting:`SCHEDULER_DISK_QUEUE` = ``"scrapy.squeues.PickleFifoDiskQueue"``
    | :setting:`SCHEDULER_MEMORY_QUEUE` = ``"scrapy.squeues.FifoMemoryQueue"``

    .. _BFO order: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search


    .. _custom-request-order:

    Crawling in a custom order
    --------------------------

    You can manually set :attr:`~scrapy.http.Request.priority` on requests to
    force a specific request order.


    .. _concurrency-v-order:

    Concurrency affects order
    -------------------------

    While pending requests are below the configured values of
    :setting:`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`, :setting:`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN`
    or :setting:`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP`, those requests are sent
    concurrently.

    As a result, the first few requests of a crawl may not follow the desired
    order. Lowering those settings to ``1`` enforces the desired order except
    for the very first request, but it significantly slows down the crawl as a
    whole.
