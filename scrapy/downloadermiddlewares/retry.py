"""
An extension to retry failed requests that are potentially caused by temporary
problems such as a connection timeout or HTTP 500 error.

You can change the behaviour of this middleware by modifing the scraping settings:
RETRY_TIMES - how many times to retry a failed page
RETRY_HTTP_CODES - which HTTP response codes to retry

Failed pages are collected on the scraping process and rescheduled at the end,
once the spider has finished crawling all regular (non failed) pages. Once
there is no more failed pages to retry this middleware sends a signal
(retry_complete), so other extensions could connect to that signal.
