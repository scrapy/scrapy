class Distribution(_Distribution):
    """Distribution with support for features, tests, and package data

    This is an enhanced version of 'distutils.dist.Distribution' that
    effectively adds the following new optional keyword arguments to 'setup()':

     'install_requires' -- a string or sequence of strings specifying project
        versions that the distribution requires when installed, in the format
        used by 'pkg_resources.require()'.  They will be installed
        automatically when the package is installed.  If you wish to use
        packages that are not available in PyPI, or want to give your users an
        alternate download location, you can add a 'find_links' option to the
        '[easy_install]' section of your project's 'setup.cfg' file, and then
        setuptools will scan the listed web pages for links that satisfy the
        requirements.

     'extras_require' -- a dictionary mapping names of optional "extras" to the
        additional requirement(s) that using those extras incurs. For example,
        this::

            extras_require = dict(reST = ["docutils>=0.3", "reSTedit"])

        indicates that the distribution can optionally provide an extra
        capability called "reST", but it can only be used if docutils and
        reSTedit are installed.  If the user installs your package using
        EasyInstall and requests one of your extras, the corresponding
        additional requirements will be installed if needed.

     'features' **deprecated** -- a dictionary mapping option names to
        'setuptools.Feature'
        objects.  Features are a portion of the distribution that can be
        included or excluded based on user options, inter-feature dependencies,
        and availability on the current system.  Excluded features are omitted
        from all setup commands, including source and binary distributions, so
        you can create multiple distributions from the same source tree.
        Feature names should be valid Python identifiers, except that they may
        contain the '-' (minus) sign.  Features can be included or excluded
        via the command line options '--with-X' and '--without-X', where 'X' is
        the name of the feature.  Whether a feature is included by default, and
        whether you are allowed to control this from the command line, is
        determined by the Feature object.  See the 'Feature' class for more
        information.

     'test_suite' -- the name of a test suite to run for the 'test' command.
        If the user runs 'python setup.py test', the package will be installed,
        and the named test suite will be run.  The format is the same as
        would be used on a 'unittest.py' command line.  That is, it is the
        dotted name of an object to import and call to generate a test suite.

     'package_data' -- a dictionary mapping package names to lists of filenames
        or globs to use to find data files contained in the named packages.
        If the dictionary has filenames or globs listed under '""' (the empty
        string), those names will be searched for in every package, in addition
        to any names for the specific package.  Data files found using these
        names/globs will be installed along with the package, in the same
        location as the package.  Note that globs are allowed to reference
        the contents of non-package subdirectories, as long as you use '/' as
        a path separator.  (Globs are automatically converted to
        platform-specific paths at runtime.)

    In addition to these new keywords, this class also has several new methods
    for manipulating the distribution's contents.  For example, the 'include()'
    and 'exclude()' methods can be thought of as in-place add and subtract
    commands that add or remove packages, modules, extensions, and so on from
    the distribution.  They are used by the feature subsystem to configure the
    distribution for the included and excluded features.

    **deprecated** -- The `Feature` facility was never completely implemented
    or supported, `has reported issues
    <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/58>`_ and will be removed in
    a future version.

    A subset of the distribution that can be excluded if unneeded/wanted

    Features are created using these keyword arguments:

      'description' -- a short, human readable description of the feature, to
         be used in error messages, and option help messages.

      'standard' -- if true, the feature is included by default if it is
         available on the current system.  Otherwise, the feature is only
         included if requested via a command line '--with-X' option, or if
         another included feature requires it.  The default setting is 'False'.

      'available' -- if true, the feature is available for installation on the
         current system.  The default setting is 'True'.

      'optional' -- if true, the feature's inclusion can be controlled from the
         command line, using the '--with-X' or '--without-X' options.  If
         false, the feature's inclusion status is determined automatically,
         based on 'availabile', 'standard', and whether any other feature
         requires it.  The default setting is 'True'.

      'require_features' -- a string or sequence of strings naming features
         that should also be included if this feature is included.  Defaults to
         empty list.  May also contain 'Require' objects that should be
         added/removed from the distribution.

      'remove' -- a string or list of strings naming packages to be removed
         from the distribution if this feature is *not* included.  If the
         feature *is* included, this argument is ignored.  This argument exists
         to support removing features that "crosscut" a distribution, such as
         defining a 'tests' feature that removes all the 'tests' subpackages
         provided by other features.  The default for this argument is an empty
         list.  (Note: the named package(s) or modules must exist in the base
         distribution when the 'setup()' function is initially called.)

      other keywords -- any other keyword arguments are saved, and passed to
         the distribution's 'include()' and 'exclude()' methods when the
         feature is included or excluded, respectively.  So, for example, you
         could pass 'packages=["a","b"]' to cause packages 'a' and 'b' to be
         added or removed from the distribution as appropriate.

    A feature must include at least one 'requires', 'remove', or other
    keyword argument.  Otherwise, it can't affect the distribution in any way.
    Note also that you can subclass 'Feature' to create your own specialized
    feature types that modify the distribution in other ways when included or
    excluded.  See the docstrings for the various methods here for more detail.
    Aside from the methods, the only feature attributes that distributions look
    at are 'description' and 'optional'.
