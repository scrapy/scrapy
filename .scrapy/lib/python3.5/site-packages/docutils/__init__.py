"""
This is the Docutils (Python Documentation Utilities) package.

Package Structure
=================

Modules:

- __init__.py: Contains component base classes, exception classes, and
  Docutils version information.

- core.py: Contains the ``Publisher`` class and ``publish_*()`` convenience
  functions.

- frontend.py: Runtime settings (command-line interface, configuration files)
  processing, for Docutils front-ends.

- io.py: Provides a uniform API for low-level input and output.

- nodes.py: Docutils document tree (doctree) node class library.

- statemachine.py: A finite state machine specialized for
  regular-expression-based text filters.

Subpackages:

- languages: Language-specific mappings of terms.

- parsers: Syntax-specific input parser modules or packages.

- readers: Context-specific input handlers which understand the data
  source and manage a parser.

- transforms: Modules used by readers and writers to modify DPS
  doctrees.

- utils: Contains the ``Reporter`` system warning class and miscellaneous
  utilities used by readers, writers, and transforms.

  utils/urischemes.py: Contains a complete mapping of known URI addressing
  scheme names to descriptions.

- utils/math: Contains functions for conversion of mathematical notation
  between different formats (LaTeX, MathML, text, ...).

- writers: Format-specific output translators.

    settings_spec = ()
    """Runtime settings specification.  Override in subclasses.

    Defines runtime settings and associated command-line options, as used by
    `docutils.frontend.OptionParser`.  This is a tuple of:

    - Option group title (string or `None` which implies no group, just a list
      of single options).

    - Description (string or `None`).

    - A sequence of option tuples.  Each consists of:

      - Help text (string)

      - List of option strings (e.g. ``['-Q', '--quux']``).

      - Dictionary of keyword arguments sent to the OptionParser/OptionGroup
        ``add_option`` method.

        Runtime setting names are derived implicitly from long option names
        ('--a-setting' becomes ``settings.a_setting``) or explicitly from the
        'dest' keyword argument.

        Most settings will also have a 'validator' keyword & function.  The
        validator function validates setting values (from configuration files
        and command-line option arguments) and converts them to appropriate
        types.  For example, the ``docutils.frontend.validate_boolean``
        function, **required by all boolean settings**, converts true values
        ('1', 'on', 'yes', and 'true') to 1 and false values ('0', 'off',
        'no', 'false', and '') to 0.  Validators need only be set once per
        setting.  See the `docutils.frontend.validate_*` functions.

        See the optparse docs for more details.

    - More triples of group title, description, options, as many times as
      needed.  Thus, `settings_spec` tuples can be simply concatenated.
