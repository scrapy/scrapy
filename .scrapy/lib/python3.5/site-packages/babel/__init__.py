    ~~~~~

    Integrated collection of utilities that assist in internationalizing and
    localizing applications.

    This package is basically composed of two major parts:

     * tools to build and work with ``gettext`` message catalogs
     * a Python interface to the CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository), providing
       access to various locale display names, localized number and date
       formatting, etc.
