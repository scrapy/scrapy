    /* This does the basic initialization of Python.  It can be called
       completely concurrently from unrelated threads.  It assumes
       that we don't hold the GIL before (if it exists), and we don't
       hold it afterwards.

       What it really does is completely different in Python 2 and 
       Python 3.

    Python 2
    ========

       Initialize the GIL, without initializing the rest of Python,
       by calling PyEval_InitThreads().

       PyEval_InitThreads() must not be called concurrently at all.
       So we use a global variable as a simple spin lock.  This global
       variable must be from 'libpythonX.Y.so', not from this
       cffi-based extension module, because it must be shared from
       different cffi-based extension modules.  We choose
       _PyParser_TokenNames[0] as a completely arbitrary pointer value
       that is never written to.  The default is to point to the
       string "ENDMARKER".  We change it temporarily to point to the
       next character in that string.  (Yes, I know it's REALLY
       obscure.)

    Python 3
    ========

       In Python 3, PyEval_InitThreads() cannot be called before
       Py_InitializeEx() any more.  So this function calls
       Py_InitializeEx() first.  It uses the same obscure logic to
       make sure we never call it concurrently.

       Arguably, this is less good on the spinlock, because
       Py_InitializeEx() takes much longer to run than
       PyEval_InitThreads().  But I didn't find a way around it.
