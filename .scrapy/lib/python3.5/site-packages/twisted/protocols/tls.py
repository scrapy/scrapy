"""
Implementation of a TLS transport (L{ISSLTransport}) as an
L{IProtocol<twisted.internet.interfaces.IProtocol>} layered on top of any
L{ITransport<twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport>} implementation, based on
U{OpenSSL<http://www.openssl.org>}'s memory BIO features.

L{TLSMemoryBIOFactory} is a L{WrappingFactory} which wraps protocols created by
the factory it wraps with L{TLSMemoryBIOProtocol}.  L{TLSMemoryBIOProtocol}
intercedes between the underlying transport and the wrapped protocol to
implement SSL and TLS.  Typical usage of this module looks like this::

    from twisted.protocols.tls import TLSMemoryBIOFactory
    from twisted.internet.protocol import ServerFactory
    from twisted.internet.ssl import PrivateCertificate
    from twisted.internet import reactor

    from someapplication import ApplicationProtocol

    serverFactory = ServerFactory()
    serverFactory.protocol = ApplicationProtocol
    certificate = PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(certPEMData)
    contextFactory = certificate.options()
    tlsFactory = TLSMemoryBIOFactory(contextFactory, False, serverFactory)
    reactor.listenTCP(12345, tlsFactory)
    reactor.run()

This API offers somewhat more flexibility than
L{twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorSSL}; for example, a
L{TLSMemoryBIOProtocol} instance can use another instance of
L{TLSMemoryBIOProtocol} as its transport, yielding TLS over TLS - useful to
implement onion routing.  It can also be used to run TLS over unusual
transports, such as UNIX sockets and stdio.

    In addition to producer events from the underlying transport, the need to
