Six is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library.  It provides utility functions
for smoothing over the differences between the Python versions with the goal of
writing Python code that is compatible on both Python versions.  See the
documentation for more information on what is provided.

Six supports every Python version since 2.6.  It is contained in only one Python
file, so it can be easily copied into your project. (The copyright and license
notice must be retained.)

Online documentation is at https://pythonhosted.org/six/.

Bugs can be reported to https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six.  The code can also
be found there.
