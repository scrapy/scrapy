    A Domain is meant to be a group of "object" description directives for
    objects of a similar nature, and corresponding roles to create references to
    them.  Examples would be Python modules, classes, functions etc., elements
    of a templating language, Sphinx roles and directives, etc.

    Each domain has a separate storage for information about existing objects
    and how to reference them in `self.data`, which must be a dictionary.  It
    also must implement several functions that expose the object information in
    a uniform way to parts of Sphinx that allow the user to reference or search
    for objects in a domain-agnostic way.

    About `self.data`: since all object and cross-referencing information is
    stored on a BuildEnvironment instance, the `domain.data` object is also
    stored in the `env.domaindata` dict under the key `domain.name`.  Before the
    build process starts, every active domain is instantiated and given the
    environment object; the `domaindata` dict must then either be nonexistent or
    a dictionary whose 'version' key is equal to the domain class'
    :attr:`data_version` attribute.  Otherwise, `IOError` is raised and the
    pickled environment is discarded.
