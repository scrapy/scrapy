cssselect: CSS Selectors for Python
===================================

*cssselect* parses `CSS3 Selectors`_ and translate them to `XPath 1.0`_
expressions. Such expressions can be used in lxml_ or another XPath engine
to find the matching elements in an XML or HTML document.

This module used to live inside of lxml as ``lxml.cssselect`` before it was
extracted as a stand-alone project.
