"""
lockfile.py - Platform-independent advisory file locks.

Requires Python 2.5 unless you apply 2.4.diff
Locking is done on a per-thread basis instead of a per-process basis.

Usage:

>>> lock = LockFile('somefile')
>>> try:
...     lock.acquire()
... except AlreadyLocked:
...     print 'somefile', 'is locked already.'
... except LockFailed:
...     print 'somefile', 'can\\'t be locked.'
... else:
...     print 'got lock'
got lock
>>> print lock.is_locked()
True
>>> lock.release()

>>> lock = LockFile('somefile')
>>> print lock.is_locked()
False
>>> with lock:
...    print lock.is_locked()
True
>>> print lock.is_locked()
False

>>> lock = LockFile('somefile')
>>> # It is okay to lock twice from the same thread...
>>> with lock:
...     lock.acquire()
...
>>> # Though no counter is kept, so you can't unlock multiple times...
>>> print lock.is_locked()
False

Exceptions:

    Error - base class for other exceptions
        LockError - base class for all locking exceptions
            AlreadyLocked - Another thread or process already holds the lock
            LockFailed - Lock failed for some other reason
        UnlockError - base class for all unlocking exceptions
            AlreadyUnlocked - File was not locked.
            NotMyLock - File was locked but not by the current thread/process
