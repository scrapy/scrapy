"""
This module defines the data structures used to represent a grammar.

Specifying grammars in pgen is possible with this grammar::

    grammar: (NEWLINE | rule)* ENDMARKER
    rule: NAME ':' rhs NEWLINE
    rhs: items ('|' items)*
    items: item+
    item: '[' rhs ']' | atom ['+' | '*']
    atom: '(' rhs ')' | NAME | STRING

This grammar is self-referencing.

This parser generator (pgen2) was created by Guido Rossum and used for lib2to3.
Most of the code has been refactored to make it more Pythonic. Since this was a
"copy" of the CPython Parser parser "pgen", there was some work needed to make
it more readable. It should also be slightly faster than the original pgen2,
because we made some optimizations.
