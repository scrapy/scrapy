        # NOTE: Right now, we are consuming the `get_completions` generator in
        #       a synchronous background thread, then passing the results one
        #       at a time over a queue, and consuming this queue in the main
        #       thread (that's what `generator_to_async_generator` does). That
        #       means that if the completer is *very* slow, we'll be showing
        #       completions in the UI once they are computed.

        #       It's very tempting to replace this implementation with the
        #       commented code below for several reasons:

        #       - `generator_to_async_generator` is not perfect and hard to get
        #         right. It's a lot of complexity for little gain. The
        #         implementation needs a huge buffer for it to be efficient
        #         when there are many completions (like 50k+).
        #       - Normally, a completer is supposed to be fast, users can have
        #         "complete while typing" enabled, and want to see the
        #         completions within a second. Handling one completion at a
        #         time, and rendering once we get it here doesn't make any
        #         sense if this is quick anyway.
        #       - Completers like `FuzzyCompleter` prepare all completions
        #         anyway so that they can be sorted by accuracy before they are
        #         yielded. At the point that we start yielding completions
        #         here, we already have all completions.
        #       - The `Buffer` class has complex logic to invalidate the UI
        #         while it is consuming the completions. We don't want to
        #         invalidate the UI for every completion (if there are many),
        #         but we want to do it often enough so that completions are
        #         being displayed while they are produced.

        #       We keep the current behavior mainly for backward-compatibility.
        #       Similarly, it would be better for this function to not return
        #       an async generator, but simply be a coroutine that returns a
        #       list of `Completion` objects, containing all completions at
        #       once.

        #       Note that this argument doesn't mean we shouldn't use
        #       `ThreadedCompleter`. It still makes sense to produce
        #       completions in a background thread, because we don't want to
