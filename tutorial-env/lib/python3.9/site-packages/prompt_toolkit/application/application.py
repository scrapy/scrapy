class Application(Generic[_AppResult]):
    """
    The main Application class!
    This glues everything together.

    :param layout: A :class:`~prompt_toolkit.layout.Layout` instance.
    :param key_bindings:
        :class:`~prompt_toolkit.key_binding.KeyBindingsBase` instance for
        the key bindings.
    :param clipboard: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.clipboard.Clipboard` to use.
    :param full_screen: When True, run the application on the alternate screen buffer.
    :param color_depth: Any :class:`~.ColorDepth` value, a callable that
        returns a :class:`~.ColorDepth` or `None` for default.
    :param erase_when_done: (bool) Clear the application output when it finishes.
    :param reverse_vi_search_direction: Normally, in Vi mode, a '/' searches
        forward and a '?' searches backward. In Readline mode, this is usually
        reversed.
    :param min_redraw_interval: Number of seconds to wait between redraws. Use
        this for applications where `invalidate` is called a lot. This could cause
        a lot of terminal output, which some terminals are not able to process.

        `None` means that every `invalidate` will be scheduled right away
        (which is usually fine).

        When one `invalidate` is called, but a scheduled redraw of a previous
        `invalidate` call has not been executed yet, nothing will happen in any
        case.

    :param max_render_postpone_time: When there is high CPU (a lot of other
        scheduled calls), postpone the rendering max x seconds.  '0' means:
        don't postpone. '.5' means: try to draw at least twice a second.

    :param refresh_interval: Automatically invalidate the UI every so many
        seconds. When `None` (the default), only invalidate when `invalidate`
        has been called.

    :param terminal_size_polling_interval: Poll the terminal size every so many
        seconds. Useful if the applications runs in a thread other then then
        main thread where SIGWINCH can't be handled, or on Windows.

    Filters:

    :param mouse_support: (:class:`~prompt_toolkit.filters.Filter` or
        boolean). When True, enable mouse support.
    :param paste_mode: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.filters.Filter` or boolean.
    :param editing_mode: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.enums.EditingMode`.

    :param enable_page_navigation_bindings: When `True`, enable the page
        navigation key bindings. These include both Emacs and Vi bindings like
        page-up, page-down and so on to scroll through pages. Mostly useful for
        creating an editor or other full screen applications. Probably, you
        don't want this for the implementation of a REPL. By default, this is
        enabled if `full_screen` is set.

    Callbacks (all of these should accept an
    :class:`~prompt_toolkit.application.Application` object as input.)

    :param on_reset: Called during reset.
    :param on_invalidate: Called when the UI has been invalidated.
    :param before_render: Called right before rendering.
    :param after_render: Called right after rendering.

    I/O:
    (Note that the preferred way to change the input/output is by creating an
    `AppSession` with the required input/output objects. If you need multiple
    applications running at the same time, you have to create a separate
    `AppSession` using a `with create_app_session():` block.

    :param input: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.input.Input` instance.
    :param output: :class:`~prompt_toolkit.output.Output` instance. (Probably
                   Vt100_Output or Win32Output.)

    Usage:

        app = Application(...)
        app.run()

        # Or
        await app.run_async()
