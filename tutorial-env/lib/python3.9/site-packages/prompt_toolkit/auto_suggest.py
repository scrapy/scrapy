`Fish-style <http://fishshell.com/>`_  like auto-suggestion.

While a user types input in a certain buffer, suggestions are generated
(asynchronously.) Usually, they are displayed after the input. When the cursor
presses the right arrow and the cursor is at the end of the input, the
suggestion will be inserted.

If you want the auto suggestions to be asynchronous (in a background thread),
because they take too much time, and could potentially block the event loop,
then wrap the :class:`.AutoSuggest` instance into a
:class:`.ThreadedAutoSuggest`.
