# By default, choose a buffer size that's a good balance between having enough
# throughput, but not consuming too much memory. We use this to consume a sync
# generator of completions as an async generator. If the queue size is very
# small (like 1), consuming the completions goes really slow (when there are a
# lot of items). If the queue size would be unlimited or too big, this can
# cause overconsumption of memory, and cause CPU time spent producing items
# that are no longer needed (if the consumption of the async generator stops at
# some point). We need a fixed size in order to get some back pressure from the
# async consumer to the sync producer. We choose 1000 by default here. If we
# have around 50k completions, measurements show that 1000 is still
# significantly faster than a buffer of 100.
