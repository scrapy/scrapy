# PyDispatcher Multi-producer Multi-consumer Observables

PyDispatcher provides the Python programmer with a multiple-producer-multiple-consumer signal-registration and
routing infrastructure for use in multiple contexts. The mechanism
of PyDispatcher started life as a highly rated [recipe](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/87056)
in the [Python Cookbook](http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/). The [project](https://github.com/mcfletch/pydispatcher) aims
to include various enhancements to the recipe developed during use in
various applications. It is primarily maintained by [Mike Fletcher](http://www.vrplumber.com). A derivative
of the project provides the Django web framework's "signal" system.

## Installation

PyDispatcher is available on PyPI via standard PIP:
```

## Usage

[Documentation](https://mcfletch.github.io/pydispatcher/) is available
for detailed usage, but the basic idea is:

```
from pydispatch import dispatcher

metaKey = "moo"
MyNode = object()
event = {"sample": "event"}


def callback(event=None):
    """Handle signal being sent"""
    print("Signal received", event)


dispatcher.connect(callback, sender=MyNode, signal=metaKey)
dispatcher.send(metaKey, MyNode, event=event)
```
