# Service Identity Verification for pyOpenSSL & *cryptography*

Use this package if:

- you want to **verify** that a [PyCA *cryptography*](https://cryptography.io/) certificate is valid for a certain hostname or IP address,
- or if you use [pyOpenSSL](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/) and don’t want to be [**MITM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)ed,
- or if you want to **inspect** certificates from either for service IDs.

*service-identity* aspires to give you all the tools you need for verifying whether a certificate is valid for the intended purposes.
In the simplest case, this means *host name verification*.
However, *service-identity* implements [RFC 6125](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125.html) fully.


## Project Information

*service-identity* is released under the [MIT](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/blob/main/LICENSE) license, its documentation lives at [Read the Docs](https://service-identity.readthedocs.io/), the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity), and the latest release on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/service-identity/).


### Credits

*service-identity* is written and maintained by [Hynek Schlawack](https://hynek.me/).

The development is kindly supported by my employer [Variomedia AG](https://www.variomedia.de/), *service-identity*'s [Tidelift subscribers][Tidelift], and all my amazing [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).


### *service-identity* for Enterprise

Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription.

The maintainers of *service-identity* and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open-source packages you use to build your applications.

## Release Information

### Removed

- All Python versions up to and including 3.7 have been dropped.
- Support for `commonName` in certificates has been dropped.
  It has been deprecated since 2017 and isn't supported by any major browser.
- The oldest supported pyOpenSSL version (when using the `pyopenssl` backend) is now 17.0.0.
  When using such an old pyOpenSSL version, you have to pin *cryptography* yourself to ensure compatibility between them.
  Please check out [`contraints/oldest-pyopenssl.txt`](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/blob/main/tests/constraints/oldest-pyopenssl.txt) to verify what we are testing against.


### Deprecated

- If you've used `service_identity.(cryptography|pyopenssl).extract_ids()`, please switch to the new names `extract_patterns()`.
  [#56](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/56)


### Added

- `service_identity.(cryptography|pyopenssl).extract_patterns()` are now public APIs (FKA `extract_ids()`).
  You can use them to extract the patterns from a certificate without verifying anything.
  [#55](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/55)
- *service-identity* is now fully typed.
  [#57](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/57)
