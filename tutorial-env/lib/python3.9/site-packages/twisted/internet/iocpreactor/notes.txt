test specifically:
failed accept error message -- similar to test_tcp_internals
immediate success on accept/connect/recv, including Event.ignore
parametrize iocpsupport somehow -- via reactor?

do:
break handling -- WaitForSingleObject on the IOCP handle?
iovecs for write buffer
do not wait for a mainloop iteration if resumeProducing (in _handleWrite) does startWriting
don't addActiveHandle in every call to startWriting/startReading
iocpified process support
  win32er-in-a-thread (or run GQCS in a thread -- it can't receive SIGBREAK)
blocking in sendto() -- I think Windows can do that, especially with local UDP

buildbot:
run in vmware
start from a persistent snapshot

use a stub inside the vm to svnup/run tests/collect stdio
lift logs through SMB? or ship them via tcp beams to the VM host

have a timeout on the test run
if we time out, take a screenshot, save it, kill the VM
