    # also need to be able to set it on an instance and get the value
    # we set. So far so good. But what gets tricky is that we'd like
    # to store the value in the C structure (``InterfaceBase.__ibmodule__``) for
    # direct access during equality, sorting, and hashing. "No
    # problem, you think, I'll just use a property" (well, the C
    # equivalents, ``PyMemberDef`` or ``PyGetSetDef``).
    #
    # Except there is a problem. When a subclass is created, the
    # metaclass (``type``) always automatically puts the expected
    # string in the class's dictionary under ``__module__``, thus
    # overriding the property inherited from the superclass. Writing
    # ``Subclass.__module__`` still works, but
    # ``Subclass().__module__`` fails.
    #
    # There are multiple ways to work around this:
    #
    # (1) Define ``InterfaceBase.__getattribute__`` to watch for
    # ``__module__`` and return the C storage.
    #
    # This works, but slows down *all* attribute access (except,
    # ironically, to ``__module__``) by about 25% (40ns becomes 50ns)
    # (when implemented in C). Since that includes methods like
    # ``providedBy``, that's probably not acceptable.
    #
    # All the other methods involve modifying subclasses. This can be
    # done either on the fly in some cases, as instances are
    # constructed, or by using a metaclass. These next few can be done on the fly.
    #
    # (2) Make ``__module__`` a descriptor in each subclass dictionary.
    # It can't be a straight up ``@property`` descriptor, though, because accessing
    # it on the class returns a ``property`` object, not the desired string.
    #
    # (3) Implement a data descriptor (``__get__`` and ``__set__``)
    # that is both a subclass of string, and also does the redirect of
    # ``__module__`` to ``__ibmodule__`` and does the correct thing
    # with the ``instance`` argument to ``__get__`` is None (returns
    # the class's value.) (Why must it be a subclass of string? Because
    # when it' s in the class's dict, it's defined on an *instance* of the
    # metaclass; descriptors in an instance's dict aren't honored --- their
    # ``__get__`` is never invoked --- so it must also *be* the value we want
    # returned.)
    #
    # This works, preserves the ability to read and write
    # ``__module__``, and eliminates any penalty accessing other
    # attributes. But it slows down accessing ``__module__`` of
    # instances by 200% (40ns to 124ns), requires editing class dicts on the fly
    # (in InterfaceClass.__init__), thus slightly slowing down all interface creation,
    # and is ugly.
    #
    # (4) As in the last step, but make it a non-data descriptor (no ``__set__``).
    #
    # If you then *also* store a copy of ``__ibmodule__`` in
    # ``__module__`` in the instance's dict, reading works for both
    # class and instance and is full speed for instances. But the cost
    # is storage space, and you can't write to it anymore, not without
    # things getting out of sync.
    #
    # (Actually, ``__module__`` was never meant to be writable. Doing
    # so would break BTrees and normal dictionaries, as well as the
    # repr, maybe more.)
    #
    # That leaves us with a metaclass. (Recall that a class is an
    # instance of its metaclass, so properties/descriptors defined in
    # the metaclass are used when accessing attributes on the
    # instance/class. We'll use that to define ``__module__``.) Here
    # we can have our cake and eat it too: no extra storage, and
    # C-speed access to the underlying storage. The only substantial
    # cost is that metaclasses tend to make people's heads hurt. (But
    # still less than the descriptor-is-string, hopefully.)
