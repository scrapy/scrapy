Compute a resolution order for an object and its bases.

.. versionchanged:: 5.0
   The resolution order is now based on the same C3 order that Python
   uses for classes. In complex instances of multiple inheritance, this
   may result in a different ordering.

   In older versions, the ordering wasn't required to be C3 compliant,
   and for backwards compatibility, it still isn't. If the ordering
   isn't C3 compliant (if it is *inconsistent*), zope.interface will
   make a best guess to try to produce a reasonable resolution order.
   Still (just as before), the results in such cases may be
   surprising.

.. rubric:: Environment Variables

Due to the change in 5.0, certain environment variables can be used to control errors
and warnings about inconsistent resolution orders. They are listed in priority order, with
variables at the bottom generally overriding variables above them.

ZOPE_INTERFACE_WARN_BAD_IRO
    If this is set to "1", then if there is at least one inconsistent resolution
    order discovered, a warning (:class:`InconsistentResolutionOrderWarning`) will
    be issued. Use the usual warning mechanisms to control this behaviour. The warning
    text will contain additional information on debugging.
ZOPE_INTERFACE_TRACK_BAD_IRO
    If this is set to "1", then zope.interface will log information about each
    inconsistent resolution order discovered, and keep those details in memory in this module
    for later inspection.
ZOPE_INTERFACE_STRICT_IRO
    If this is set to "1", any attempt to use :func:`ro` that would produce a non-C3
    ordering will fail by raising :class:`InconsistentResolutionOrderError`.

.. important::

   ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_STRICT_IRO`` is intended to become the default in the future.

There are two environment variables that are independent.

ZOPE_INTERFACE_LOG_CHANGED_IRO
    If this is set to "1", then if the C3 resolution order is different from
    the legacy resolution order for any given object, a message explaining the differences
    will be logged. This is intended to be used for debugging complicated IROs.
ZOPE_INTERFACE_USE_LEGACY_IRO
    If this is set to "1", then the C3 resolution order will *not* be used. The
    legacy IRO will be used instead. This is a temporary measure and will be removed in the
    future. It is intended to help during the transition.
    It implies ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_LOG_CHANGED_IRO``.

.. rubric:: Debugging Behaviour Changes in zope.interface 5

Most behaviour changes from zope.interface 4 to 5 are related to
inconsistent resolution orders. ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_STRICT_IRO`` is the
most effective tool to find such inconsistent resolution orders, and
we recommend running your code with this variable set if at all
possible. Doing so will ensure that all interface resolution orders
are consistent, and if they're not, will immediately point the way to
where this is violated.

Occasionally, however, this may not be enough. This is because in some
cases, a C3 ordering can be found (the resolution order is fully
consistent) that is substantially different from the ad-hoc legacy
ordering. In such cases, you may find that you get an unexpected value
returned when adapting one or more objects to an interface. To debug
this, *also* enable ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_LOG_CHANGED_IRO`` and examine the
output. The main thing to look for is changes in the relative
positions of interfaces for which there are registered adapters.

        #  pass
        #
        # However, older versions of zope.interface were fine with this order.
        # A good example is ``providedBy(IOError())``. Because of the way
        # ``classImplements`` works, it winds up with ``__bases__`` ==
        # ``[IEnvironmentError, IIOError, IOSError, <implementedBy Exception>]``
        # (on Python 3). But ``IEnvironmentError`` is a base of both ``IIOError``
        # and ``IOSError``. Previously, we would get a resolution order of
        # ``[IIOError, IOSError, IEnvironmentError, IStandardError, IException, Interface]``
        # but the standard Python algorithm would forbid creating that order entirely.

        # Unlike Python's MRO, we attempt to resolve the issue. A few
        # heuristics have been tried. One was:
        #
        # Strip off the first (highest priority) base of each direct
        # base one at a time and seeing if we can come to an agreement
        # with the other bases. (We're trying for a partial ordering
        # here.) This often resolves cases (such as the IOSError case
        # above), and frequently produces the same ordering as the
        # legacy MRO did. If we looked at all the highest priority
        # bases and couldn't find any partial ordering, then we strip
        # them *all* out and begin the C3 step again. We take care not
        # to promote a common root over all others.
        #
        # If we only did the first part, stripped off the first
        # element of the first item, we could resolve simple cases.
        # But it tended to fail badly. If we did the whole thing, it
        # could be extremely painful from a performance perspective
        # for deep/wide things like Zope's OFS.SimpleItem.Item. Plus,
        # anytime you get ExtensionClass.Base into the mix, you're
