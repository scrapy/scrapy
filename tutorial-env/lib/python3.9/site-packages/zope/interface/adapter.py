class BaseAdapterRegistry:
    """
    A basic implementation of the data storage and algorithms required
    for a :class:`zope.interface.interfaces.IAdapterRegistry`.

    Subclasses can set the following attributes to control how the data
    is stored; in particular, these hooks can be helpful for ZODB
    persistence. They can be class attributes that are the named (or similar) type, or
    they can be methods that act as a constructor for an object that behaves
    like the types defined here; this object will not assume that they are type
    objects, but subclasses are free to do so:

    _sequenceType = list
      This is the type used for our two mutable top-level "byorder" sequences.
      Must support mutation operations like ``append()`` and ``del seq[index]``.
      These are usually small (< 10). Although at least one of them is
      accessed when performing lookups or queries on this object, the other
      is untouched. In many common scenarios, both are only required when
      mutating registrations and subscriptions (like what
      :meth:`zope.interface.interfaces.IComponents.registerUtility` does).
      This use pattern makes it an ideal candidate to be a
      :class:`~persistent.list.PersistentList`.
    _leafSequenceType = tuple
      This is the type used for the leaf sequences of subscribers.
      It could be set to a ``PersistentList`` to avoid many unnecessary data
      loads when subscribers aren't being used. Mutation operations are directed
      through :meth:`_addValueToLeaf` and :meth:`_removeValueFromLeaf`; if you use
      a mutable type, you'll need to override those.
    _mappingType = dict
      This is the mutable mapping type used for the keyed mappings.
      A :class:`~persistent.mapping.PersistentMapping`
      could be used to help reduce the number of data loads when the registry is large
      and parts of it are rarely used. Further reductions in data loads can come from
      using a :class:`~BTrees.OOBTree.OOBTree`, but care is required
      to be sure that all required/provided
      values are fully ordered (e.g., no required or provided values that are classes
      can be used).
    _providedType = dict
      This is the mutable mapping type used for the ``_provided`` mapping.
      This is separate from the generic mapping type because the values
      are always integers, so one might choose to use a more optimized data
      structure such as a :class:`~BTrees.OIBTree.OIBTree`.
      The same caveats regarding key types
      apply as for ``_mappingType``.

    It is possible to also set these on an instance, but because of the need to
    potentially also override :meth:`_addValueToLeaf` and :meth:`_removeValueFromLeaf`,
    this may be less useful in a persistent scenario; using a subclass is recommended.

    .. versionchanged:: 5.3.0
        Add support for customizing the way internal data
        structures are created.
    .. versionchanged:: 5.3.0
        Add methods :meth:`rebuild`, :meth:`allRegistrations`
        and :meth:`allSubscriptions`.

    # a fair bit of information for each name.  It's better to
    # be space efficient here and be time efficient in the cache
