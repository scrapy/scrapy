"""
Mapping Interfaces.

Importing this module does *not* mark any standard classes as
implementing any of these interfaces.

While this module is not deprecated, new code should generally use
:mod:`zope.interface.common.collections`, specifically
:class:`~zope.interface.common.collections.IMapping` and
:class:`~zope.interface.common.collections.IMutableMapping`. This
module is occasionally useful for its extremely fine grained breakdown
of interfaces.

The standard library :class:`dict` and :class:`collections.UserDict`
implement ``IMutableMapping``, but *do not* implement any of the
interfaces in this module.
