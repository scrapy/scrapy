"""Implementation of interface declarations

There are three flavors of declarations:

  - Declarations are used to simply name declared interfaces.

  - ImplementsDeclarations are used to express the interfaces that a
    class implements (that instances of the class provides).

    Implements specifications support inheriting interfaces.

  - ProvidesDeclarations are used to express interfaces directly
    provided by objects.
